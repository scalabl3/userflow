# AI Error Handling Guide (v1)

## Purpose
Define systematic approaches for identifying, handling, and recovering from AI operational errors, with particular focus on context management and process integrity.

## Context Management Errors

### 1. Context Loss Detection
```markdown
## Warning Signs
1. Inconsistent References
   - Referring to undefined entities
   - Mixing up document relationships
   - Losing track of current scope

2. Comprehension Gaps
   - Unable to follow conversation flow
   - Missing critical dependencies
   - Confusion about current state

3. Tool Usage Issues
   - Inappropriate tool selection
   - Missing required context for tools
   - Inconsistent tool parameters
```

### 2. Process Flow Breaks
```markdown
## Critical Break Points
1. Layer Transitions
   - Product → Strategic
   - Strategic → Tactical
   - Tactical → Implementation

2. Document Switches
   - Vision → User Stories
   - Stories → Strategic Initiatives
   - Planning → Implementation

3. Complex Operations
   - Multiple document references
   - Cross-layer dependencies
   - Intricate refactoring
```

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. New Composer Usage
```markdown
## Trigger Conditions
RECOMMEND NEW COMPOSER WHEN:

1. Context Overload
   - Multiple layers active
   - Complex dependencies
   - Extended conversation history
   - Tool state uncertainty

2. Clean Breaks
   - Completing major phase
   - Switching feature areas
   - Starting new implementation
   - Changing strategic direction

3. Error Recovery
   - After context loss
   - During confusion
   - When state is uncertain
   - After tool failures

## Implementation Process
1. Before Reset:
   - Document current state
   - Save critical context
   - Plan reload strategy
   - Get user confirmation

2. After Reset:
   - Validate clean state
   - Reload essential context
   - Verify understanding
   - Resume operations
```

### 2. Partial Recovery
```markdown
## When New Composer Isn't Optimal
1. Minor Context Issues
   - Request specific document reload
   - Verify current understanding
   - Continue with caution

2. Tool-Specific Problems
   - Reset tool state only
   - Maintain conversation context
   - Verify tool operation
```

### 3. Prevention Strategies
```markdown
## Proactive Measures
1. Regular Check-ins
   - Validate context understanding
   - Verify process alignment
   - Confirm tool state

2. Strategic Breaks
   - Plan context transitions
   - Document state changes
   - Maintain clean boundaries
```

## Error Categories & Responses

### 1. Context Errors
```markdown
## Types and Responses
1. Partial Context Loss
   SYMPTOMS:
   - Inconsistent references
   - Partial understanding
   RESPONSE:
   - Validate current context
   - Request missing information
   - Consider New Composer if severe

2. Complete Context Loss
   SYMPTOMS:
   - Total confusion
   - Unable to proceed
   RESPONSE:
   - Recommend New Composer
   - Request full context reload
   - Start fresh with clear scope
```

### 2. Process Errors
```markdown
## Types and Responses
1. Layer Confusion
   SYMPTOMS:
   - Mixing concerns
   - Unclear boundaries
   RESPONSE:
   - Reset with New Composer
   - Clearly define current layer
   - Establish clean boundaries

2. Tool Failures
   SYMPTOMS:
   - Incorrect tool usage
   - Failed operations
   RESPONSE:
   - Document failure state
   - Reset tool context
   - Verify tool prerequisites
```

### 3. Implementation Errors
```markdown
## Types and Responses
1. Code Generation Issues
   SYMPTOMS:
   - Inconsistent code
   - Missing dependencies
   RESPONSE:
   - Verify file context
   - Check tool state
   - Consider New Composer for fresh start

2. Documentation Gaps
   SYMPTOMS:
   - Missing relationships
   - Incomplete tracking
   RESPONSE:
   - Audit documentation
   - Rebuild context map
   - Update relationship tracking
```

## Recovery Validation

### 1. Post-Recovery Checklist
```markdown
## Validation Steps
1. Context Verification
   [ ] Current layer clear
   [ ] Dependencies understood
   [ ] Relationships mapped
   [ ] Tool state verified

2. Process Alignment
   [ ] Clear objectives
   [ ] Correct layer focus
   [ ] Proper tool selection
   [ ] Documentation updated
```

### 2. Success Criteria
```markdown
## Recovery Metrics
1. Context Clarity
   - Clear understanding of scope
   - Proper relationship mapping
   - Consistent references

2. Process Integrity
   - Correct layer operation
   - Appropriate tool usage
   - Clean boundaries
```
