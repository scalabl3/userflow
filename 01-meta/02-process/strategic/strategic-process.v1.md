# Strategic Process (v1)

## File Nomenclature
- Strategic Initiative: SI-[AREA]-[NUMBER]
- Strategic Plan Location: 02-implementation-docs/strategic/[SI-ID]/strategic-plan.md
- Pattern Documentation: 02-implementation-docs/patterns/[status]/[domain]/

## Purpose
Define the process for identifying, analyzing, and responding to system-wide patterns and strategic initiatives.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Pattern Recognition & Analysis
- Monitor system for recurring issues and opportunities
- Identify root causes and impact areas
- Document patterns using standard templates
- Track pattern evolution and relationships

### 2. Strategic Initiative Management
- Create and maintain strategic initiatives
- Define success metrics and outcomes
- Track initiative progress and effectiveness
- Ensure alignment with system goals

### 3. Knowledge Management
- Maintain pattern documentation
- Create and update solution templates
- Share learnings across initiatives
- Build prevention mechanisms

## Process Workflows

### 1. Pattern Recognition Process
```markdown
1. Pattern Identification
   - Monitor system behavior
   - Track recurring issues
   - Identify common themes

2. Impact Analysis
   - Map affected areas
   - Assess severity
   - Document dependencies

3. Pattern Documentation
   - Create pattern record
   - Link related patterns
   - Document known solutions
```

### 2. Strategic Initiative Creation
```markdown
1. Initiative Definition
   - Create SI-[AREA]-[NUMBER]
   - Define scope and goals
   - Set success metrics

2. Planning
   - Create strategic plan
   - Define tactical needs
   - Set verification points

3. Progress Tracking
   - Monitor metrics
   - Track pattern changes
   - Update documentation
```

### 3. Knowledge Management Process
```markdown
1. Documentation
   - Update pattern records
   - Create solution templates
   - Document learnings

2. Prevention
   - Design preventive measures
   - Create verification points
   - Monitor effectiveness

3. Knowledge Sharing
   - Update process docs
   - Share learnings
   - Train team members
```

## Strategic Gates

### 1. Pattern Recognition Gate
```markdown
[ ] Pattern properly identified
[ ] Impact areas mapped
[ ] Root causes documented
[ ] Related patterns linked
```

### 2. Initiative Creation Gate
```markdown
[ ] Clear strategic value
[ ] Measurable outcomes defined
[ ] Resources identified
[ ] Dependencies mapped
```

### 3. Knowledge Management Gate
```markdown
[ ] Documentation complete
[ ] Prevention mechanisms defined
[ ] Verification points established
[ ] Knowledge shared
```

## Integration Points

### 1. To Tactical Layer
- Provide pattern context
- Define success metrics
- Set verification requirements
- Track implementation effectiveness

### 2. From Tactical Layer
- Implementation feedback
- Pattern verification
- Solution effectiveness
- Learning opportunities
