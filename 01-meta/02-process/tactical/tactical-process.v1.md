# Tactical Process (v1)

## Template Reference
Use template at: `01-meta/01-templates/tactical-planning.v1.template.md` for creating tactical documents.

## File Nomenclature
- Tactical Plan: TP-[AREA]-[NUMBER]
- Tactical Plan Location: 02-implementation-docs/product/tactical/[TP-ID]/tactical-plan.md
- Implementation Documentation: 02-implementation-docs/product/tactical/[TP-ID]/implementation/
- Tactical Initiative: TI-[SI-REF]-[NUMBER]
- Task Location: 02-implementation-docs/tasks/[SI-REF]/TASK-[TI-REF]-[NUMBER].md

## Purpose
Define the process for implementing strategic initiatives through tactical planning, task management, and verification.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Implementation Planning
- Break down strategic initiatives into tactical plans
- Manage dependencies and resources
- Create and track tasks
- Ensure pattern compliance

### 2. Verification Framework
- Define verification points
- Ensure test coverage
- Validate pattern compliance
- Track implementation quality

### 3. Progress Management
- Track task completion
- Monitor implementation quality
- Report tactical progress
- Manage blockers

## Process Workflows

### 1. Tactical Planning Process
```markdown
1. Initiative Analysis
   - Review strategic initiative
   - Identify implementation needs
   - Map dependencies

2. Plan Creation
   - Create TI-[SI-REF]-[NUMBER]
   - Define implementation steps
   - Set verification points

3. Task Generation
   - Create task breakdown
   - Define task dependencies
   - Set completion criteria
```

### 2. Implementation Process
```markdown
1. Task Management
   - Assign tasks
   - Track progress
   - Handle blockers

2. Quality Control
   - Verify pattern compliance
   - Check test coverage
   - Validate changes

3. Progress Tracking
   - Update task status
   - Monitor metrics
   - Report progress
```

### 3. Verification Process
```markdown
1. Quality Gates
   - Pre-implementation checks
   - Implementation verification
   - Post-implementation review

2. Pattern Compliance
   - Check against patterns
   - Verify solutions
   - Document deviations

3. Documentation
   - Update task status
   - Record learnings
   - Report issues
```

## Tactical Gates

### 1. Planning Gate
```markdown
[ ] Strategic initiative understood
[ ] Implementation plan complete
[ ] Dependencies mapped
[ ] Resources identified
```

### 2. Implementation Gate
```markdown
[ ] Tasks properly defined
[ ] Pattern compliance checked
[ ] Tests planned
[ ] Documentation ready
```

### 3. Verification Gate
```markdown
[ ] All tests passing
[ ] Patterns followed
[ ] Documentation complete
[ ] Learnings captured
```

## Integration Points

### 1. From Strategic Layer
- Receive patterns
- Get success metrics
- Understand context
- Get verification requirements

### 2. To Strategic Layer
- Provide implementation feedback
- Report pattern effectiveness
- Share learnings
- Suggest improvements
