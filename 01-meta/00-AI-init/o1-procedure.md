Certainly! Below is an ASCII tree diagram outlining the order in which you should generate your specification files (data-model.spec, dto.spec, repository.spec, service.spec, api.spec) to ensure consistency and proper dependencies within your system. This structured approach will help prevent confusion and maintain a clear workflow.

Spec Generation Order
└── data-model.spec
    ├── Define Models/Entities
    ├── Update Database Schema/Migrations
    └── Document Relationships

└── dto.spec
    ├── Define Create DTOs
    ├── Define Update DTOs
    └── Define Response DTOs

└── repository.spec
    ├── Define Repository Interfaces
    └── Implement Repository Classes

└── service.spec
    ├── Define Service Interfaces
    └── Implement Service Classes

└── api.spec
    ├── Define API Endpoints/Controllers
    └── Implement API Methods

Step-by-Step Explanation
	1.	data-model.spec
	•	Purpose: Establish the foundational data structures and database schema.
	•	Actions:
	•	Define all models/entities (e.g., User, Organization).
	•	Update the database schema with necessary migrations (e.g., adding phoneNumber).
	•	Document relationships between entities (e.g., One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
	2.	dto.spec
	•	Purpose: Define the data transfer objects that facilitate communication between different layers.
	•	Actions:
	•	Define Create DTOs for incoming data (e.g., CreateUserDTO).
	•	Define Update DTOs for modifying existing data (e.g., UpdateUserDTO).
	•	Define Response DTOs for outgoing data (e.g., UserDTO).
	3.	repository.spec
	•	Purpose: Abstract the data access logic, providing a clean interface for database operations.
	•	Actions:
	•	Define repository interfaces outlining CRUD operations.
	•	Implement repository classes that interact with the database using the defined models.
	4.	service.spec
	•	Purpose: Encapsulate the business logic, orchestrating operations between controllers and repositories.
	•	Actions:
	•	Define service interfaces specifying business operations (e.g., UserService).
	•	Implement service classes that contain the core business logic and interact with repositories.
	5.	api.spec
	•	Purpose: Define the API endpoints/controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.
	•	Actions:
	•	Define API endpoints/controllers mapping HTTP routes to service methods (e.g., UserController).
	•	Implement API methods that process incoming requests, invoke services, and return appropriate responses.

Additional Considerations
	•	Frontend Specifications:
	•	If applicable, follow a similar structured approach for frontend specs (e.g., frontend-dto.spec, frontend-component.spec).
	•	Validation and Testing:
	•	Ensure that each spec includes validation rules and update your testing suites accordingly to accommodate the new phoneNumber property.
	•	Documentation:
	•	Update your API documentation to reflect the changes, ensuring that all stakeholders are informed about the new property and its usage.

Benefits of This Structured Approach
	•	Clear Dependencies: By following this order, you ensure that each layer has the necessary information from the previous steps, preventing missing dependencies.
	•	Maintainability: A well-structured generation process makes it easier to manage and update your system as it grows.
	•	Scalability: This approach lays a solid foundation, allowing you to incrementally add more features without disrupting existing functionality.
	•	Consistency: Ensures that all parts of the system adhere to the same standards and structures, reducing the likelihood of errors.

By adhering to this ordered and structured generation process, you can effectively manage changes across your system with minimal confusion and maintain a clean, scalable architecture.
