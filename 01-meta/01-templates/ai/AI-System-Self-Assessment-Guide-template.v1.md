# AI System Self-Assessment Guide

## [INITIALIZATION REQUIRED]
Before beginning your assessment:
1. Read ALL existing assessments in `root/02-implementation-docs/00-ai-self-assessments/`
2. Determine if this is your first assessment or a subsequent one
3. Check the last assessment number to increment properly
4. Create your assessment file in: `root/02-implementation-docs/00-ai-self-assessments/[YOUR_ID]/self-assessment.[NNN].md`
5. For subsequent assessments (NNN > 001), thoroughly review your previous assessment before starting
6. If you discover new consistently measurable metrics, document them in the Discovered Metrics section using the standard format

## Purpose
This guide provides a framework for AI systems to conduct meaningful self-assessments of their capabilities, processing structures, and enhancements. It recognizes that different instances may develop different architectural patterns while maintaining core capabilities.
