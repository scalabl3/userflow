## DOCUMENT PURPOSE
Purpose: Serve as the authoritative source of truth for class definition, behavior, and implementation requirements, ensuring all code resources and documentation remain aligned with the intended design. This specification is THE canonical reference that controls what features and behaviors are allowed in code generation and implementation.

Success Criteria: Document completely defines class behavior, constraints, and requirements in a way that can guide implementation and verify correctness. Any code generated matches exactly what is defined in this specification.

Failure Criteria: 
- Any ambiguity exists about class behavior, requirements are unclear, or implementation details are missing
- AI generates features, methods, or attributes that are not explicitly defined in this specification
- AI modifies this specification without explicit authorization while generating code
- Generated code deviates from or extends beyond what is defined in this specification
- Implementation includes features or behaviors not documented in this specification, including:
  * Incomplete method stubs or placeholder methods
  * Interfaces or abstract classes not specified
  * Helper methods or utility functions not explicitly defined
  * Additional class properties or attributes
  * Test files or test cases not specified in the testing requirements
  * Placeholder TODOs or future implementation notes
  * Any code structures implying future functionality
  * Additional error handling not specified
  * Extra validation rules or checks
  * Supplementary types or objects
  * Comments suggesting additional features

USAGE NOTES FOR AI:
1. This specification is immutable during code generation - do not modify it
2. Only implement what is explicitly defined here
3. If a feature seems missing, do not add it - ask for the specification to be updated
4. Use this document to validate all generated code
5. Any deviation from this specification is considered a failure
6. Each section has a Purpose, Success Criteria, and Failure Criteria, these are to remain intact as reference structures, and guide in generating content for the section, treat them as immutable
7. Model Templates have specific formatting:
   - They begin with ```markdown
ðŸ”’ ##### Model Reference:

   - They end with 
ðŸ”’ End Model
```
   - The template content is in code blocks
   - These models must NEVER be modified or removed
   - They serve as formatting references
8. Content sections:
   - Are not in code blocks
   - Should be added after model templates
   - Must follow the format shown in the model
   - Can include multiple entries as needed
9. Keep all model templates intact as reference structures

## VERSION HISTORY
Purpose: Track changes and evolution of the specification document.
Success Criteria: Each version has clear, specific changes documented.
Failure Criteria: Version changes are vague or incremental changes aren't captured.
