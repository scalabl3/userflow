# [Project Name] Class Hierarchy

> Template Instructions:
> This template is designed to document the high-level class relationships and hierarchy in your system.
> Replace all placeholder text (indicated by [square brackets]) with your project-specific details.
> Delete any sections that don't apply to your project.
> Add additional sections as needed for your specific architecture.

## Summary of Relationships

### Is-A Relationships
> List all inheritance relationships. Example:
- [ChildClass] is-a [ParentClass] (with [specific characteristics])
  - [GrandchildClass] is-a [ChildClass] (scope: [scope description])

### Has-A Relationships
> List all composition/aggregation relationships. Example:
- [Container] has-many [Contained]
- [Owner] has-one [Owned]
- [Entity] authored-by one [Author]

## Class Hierarchy

### [Root Class]
- [Purpose/responsibility]
- [Key characteristics]
```typescript
[RootClass]
├── [Relationship1]
├── [Relationship2]
└── [RelationshipN]
```

### [Class Name]
- [Class purpose]
- [Key relationships]
```typescript
[ClassName]
├── [Relationship1] (reference)
├── [Relationship2][]
└── [RelationshipN]
```

## Access Control Flow
1. [First validation step]
2. [Second validation step]
3. [Additional steps as needed]

## Data Isolation
> Document your data isolation strategy. Example points:
- [Isolation rule 1]
- [Isolation rule 2]
- [Cross-boundary rules]

## Key Constraints
1. [Access control constraint]
2. [Data integrity constraint]
3. [Business rule constraint]
4. [Add more constraints as needed]

## Key Concepts

### [Concept Group Name]
> Document important conceptual distinctions in your system. Example:

1. [Concept A] ([Type/Category]):
   - [Key characteristic]
   - [Purpose]
   - [Example: "concrete example"]

2. [Concept B] ([Type/Category]):
   - [Key characteristic]
   - [Purpose]
   - [Example: "concrete example"]

This separation enables:
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]

This specification provides:
1. [Key aspect 1]
2. [Key aspect 2]
3. [Key aspect 3]
4. [Key aspect 4]
5. [Key aspect 5]
