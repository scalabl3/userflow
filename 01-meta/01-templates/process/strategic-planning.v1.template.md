```

## Strategic Analysis

### 1. Problem Space
```markdown
Root Causes:
- [Cause 1]:
  - Evidence: [data/observations]
  - Impact: [affected areas]
  - Frequency: [occurrence pattern]

System Impact:
- Technical Areas:
  - [Area 1] -> [Impact Description]
  - [Area 2] -> [Impact Description]
- Business Impact:
  - [Impact 1] -> [Severity/Cost]
  - [Impact 2] -> [Severity/Cost]
```

### 2. Solution Strategy
```markdown
Prevention Mechanisms:
- [Mechanism 1]:
  ID: PM-[NUMBER]
  Purpose: [what it prevents]
  Implementation: [high-level approach]
  Verification: [how to verify]

Success Metrics:
- [Metric 1]:
  ID: SM-[NUMBER]
  Current Value: [baseline]
  Target Value: [goal]
  Measurement: [method]
```

## Implementation Hierarchy

### 1. Tactical Layer
```markdown
Tactical Initiatives:
1. TI-[SI-REF]-001:
   Purpose: [specific focus]
   Prevention: PM-[NUMBER]
   Metrics: SM-[NUMBER]
   Location: 02-implementation-docs/tactical/[TI-ID]/

2. TI-[SI-REF]-002:
   Purpose: [specific focus]
   Prevention: PM-[NUMBER]
   Metrics: SM-[NUMBER]
   Location: 02-implementation-docs/tactical/[TI-ID]/
```

### 2. Todo Layer
```markdown
Todo Groups:
1. [SI-REF]-001:
   Purpose: [group focus]
   Patterns: [patterns addressed]
   Success Criteria: [from strategic metrics]
   Location: 02-implementation-docs/todo/[SI-REF]-001/
   
Expected Tasks:
- Category: [task type]
  Pattern Coverage: [which patterns]
  Verification Needs: [requirements]
  Template: 01-meta/01-templates/task/code-generation-task.v1.template.md
```

### 3. Integration Points
```markdown
Knowledge Flow:
Strategic → Tactical:
- Pattern: [PAT-ID] → Implementation: [TI-ID]
- Prevention: [PM-ID] → Solution: [SOL-ID]
- Metrics: [SM-ID] → Verification: [VER-ID]

Tactical → Todo:
- Implementation → Work Items
- Solutions → Task Groups
- Verification → Checkpoints

Todo → Tasks:
- Work Items → Specific Changes
- Groups → Individual Tasks
- Checkpoints → Verification Points
```

## Quality Gates

### 1. Pattern Recognition Gate
```markdown
[ ] Pattern properly identified
[ ] Impact areas mapped
[ ] Root causes documented
[ ] Related patterns linked
[ ] Documentation locations identified
```

### 2. Solution Strategy Gate
```markdown
[ ] Prevention mechanisms defined
[ ] Success metrics established
[ ] Tactical initiatives outlined
[ ] Dependencies mapped
[ ] Resources identified
```

### 3. Implementation Gate
```markdown
[ ] Documentation prepared
[ ] Knowledge base updated
[ ] Tactical plans reviewed
[ ] Verification points set
[ ] Monitoring in place
```

## Progress Tracking

### 1. Pattern Status
```markdown
Current State:
- Pattern Occurrence: [rate]
- Impact Level: [severity]
- Prevention Effectiveness: [measure]

Implementation Progress:
- TI-[SI-REF]-001: [status]
  └── Todo Group: [status]
      └── Tasks: [completed]/[total]
- TI-[SI-REF]-002: [status]
  └── Todo Group: [status]
      └── Tasks: [completed]/[total]
```

### 2. Knowledge Management
```markdown
Documentation:
- Pattern Documentation
  └── Solutions Applied
      └── Implementation Results
          └── Effectiveness Metrics

Updates Required:
- [ ] Process documents
- [ ] Templates
- [ ] Guidelines
- [ ] Training materials
```
