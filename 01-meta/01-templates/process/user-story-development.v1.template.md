# User Story Development Guide (v1)

## Purpose
Guide AI assistants in creating and managing user stories that capture user needs and drive implementation decisions.

## Story Structure
```markdown
As a [type of user]
I want to [perform some action]
So that [achieve some outcome]

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Given [context]
   When [action]
   Then [expected result]
```

## Story Levels
1. **Epic Level**
   - Broad user needs
   - Major capability areas
   - Long-term value propositions

2. **Feature Level**
   - Specific functionality
   - Clear user interactions
   - Measurable outcomes

3. **Task Level**
   - Implementation details
   - Technical requirements
   - Verification points

## Story Development Process
1. Start with user need
2. Define success criteria
3. Break into smaller stories
4. Link to strategic patterns
5. Create implementation tasks

## User Need Analysis Framework
```markdown
USER CONTEXT:
- Who is the user?
- What are they trying to achieve?
- What are their constraints?
- What defines success?

CAPABILITY MATCH:
- What can AI provide?
- What are the limitations?
- How to handle edge cases?
- What's the fallback plan?
```

## Context Management
```markdown
STORY TRANSITION POINTS:
1. Epic Level
   - Between major capability areas
   - After user need analysis
   - Before breaking into features

2. Feature Level
   - Between unrelated features
   - After acceptance criteria
   - Before implementation details

3. Task Level
   - Complex requirement sets
   - Multiple dependency chains
   - Cross-cutting concerns

Use New Composer strategically at these points to maintain clear story context.
```

## Technical Notes Structure
```markdown
## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- List essential functionality required for base implementation
- Include core system capabilities
- Define fundamental features

System-wide Constraints:
- List system-wide rules and limitations
- Define cross-cutting concerns
- Specify global requirements

Implementation Requirements:
- Detail specific implementation needs
- Define base functionality scope
- List essential technical requirements

# =====================================================
# SCOPE BOUNDARY - Base Implementation Ends Here
# =====================================================
# The following section describes features that are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE
# for the base template implementation. These are documented for awareness and future
# extension possibilities only.

### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
- List important but non-blocking features
- Include planned enhancements
- Define secondary capabilities

### Advanced Capabilities (Nice to Have)
- List future possibilities
- Include advanced features
- Define stretch goals

# Future Considerations
- List enterprise or advanced features not in base implementation
- Document potential extensions
- Note infrastructure requirements
```
