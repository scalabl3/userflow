# AI Generative MonoRepo

## Overview
A fully AI-generated monorepo implementation with complete MVC architecture, created entirely through AI pair programming. No human coding was involved in the implementation.

## AI Generation Process
1. **Completely AI Generated Coding**
   - Zero human code writing
   - All code generated through AI pair programming (with single human operator)
   - Full test coverage and documentation

2. **AI Tools & Models Used**
   - Cursor IDE + Claude Sonnet 3.5:2024-1022
   - Aider Architect + GPT4 and o1-mini
   - Coordinated development between Composer and Aider

3. **Development Timeline**
   - Complete implementation in under 3 working days
   - Iterative development with continuous testing
   - Version controlled with semantic versioning

## Project Structure

### Backend (NestJS)
1. **Models**
   - BaseUser
   - User
   - LoginCredential
   - LoginProvider
   - Organization
   - Profile (planned)

2. **Services**
   - BaseUserService
   - UserService
   - LoginCredentialService
   - LoginProviderService
   - OrganizationService

3. **Controllers**
   - BaseUserController
   - UserController
   - LoginCredentialController
   - LoginProviderController
   - OrganizationController

4. **DTOs**
   - Request/Response DTOs for all entities
   - Create/Update DTOs with validation
   - Shared DTOs between frontend and backend

5. **Tests**
   - Unit tests for all models
   - Service layer tests
   - Controller tests
   - Integration tests
   - 90%+ coverage target

6. **Database**
   - TypeORM integration
   - SQLite compatibility
   - Migration system
   - Relationship management

### Shared Package
1. **DTOs**
   - Shared data transfer objects
   - Input validation
   - Type definitions

2. **Enums**
   - CredentialType
   - OAuthProvider
   - UserState

### Frontend (React)
1. **Components**
   - User management
   - Authentication
   - Organization management

2. **Services**
   - API integration
   - State management
   - Authentication flow

## Key Features
