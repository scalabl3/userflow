Lets do a comprehensive add/commit from root folder of project.
You can combine git commands together, but you can't have newlines in the command.

1. `git add .`
2. git commmit with a very detailed message
3. git merge current branch with `main`
4. git tag release
5. git push to origin
6. git checkout develop/0.8.9.7
