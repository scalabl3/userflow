# Integration Tests Design

## Site Context
This application serves as a base template for building small to medium-sized web applications (up to 10K users). Key characteristics:
- Simple multi-user support with organization-based grouping
- Flexible authentication via configurable login providers
- System administration for site configuration
- Organizations can have multiple users (e.g., family groups, small teams)
- Multiple authentication methods per user
- Future support for organization billing and subscriptions (not implemented yet)

## Test Categories

### 1. System Administration
Tests covering site-wide configuration and management.

#### Login Provider Management
```typescript
describe('Login Provider Management', () => {
  // Provider CRUD (System Admin Only)
  it('should allow system admin to create login provider with code and name')
  it('should allow system admin to enable/disable providers')
  it('should prevent duplicate provider codes')
  it('should prevent non-system-admin from managing providers')
  
  // Provider Types
  it('should configure password-based provider')
  it('should configure OAuth2 provider (Google)')
  it('should configure OAuth2 provider (GitHub)')
  it('should configure Sign in with Apple provider')
  
  // Provider State
  it('should maintain existing credentials when disabling provider')
  it('should prevent new registrations for disabled providers')
})
```

### 2. User Registration Flow
Tests covering the complete user registration process.

#### Registration Process
```typescript
describe('User Registration', () => {
  // BaseUser Creation
  it('should create BaseUser with required fields')
  it('should set initial state to PENDING')
  it('should validate unique contact email')
  
  // LoginCredential Creation
  it('should create password-based credential')
  it('should create OAuth credential with tokens')
  it('should create Apple sign-in credential with identity token')
  it('should enforce one credential per provider per user')
  
  // Optional Organization
  it('should allow registration without organization')
  it('should create private organization if requested')
  it('should join existing organization if code provided')
})
```

### 3. Organization Management
Tests covering organization functionality.

#### Organization Basics
```typescript
describe('Organization Management', () => {
  // Creation and Setup
  it('should create organization with initial user')
  it('should set organization name')
  it('should track organization creation date')
  
  // Member Management
  it('should add users to organization')
  it('should remove users from organization')
  it('should track number of users')
  
  // Feature Access
  it('should grant feature access to organization members')
  it('should maintain individual user preferences within organization')
})
```

### 4. User Management
Tests covering user lifecycle and relationships.

#### User States
```typescript
describe('User States', () => {
  // State Transitions
  it('should transition from PENDING to ACTIVE')
  it('should handle SUSPENDED state')
  it('should process DEACTIVATED state')
  it('should track last login timestamp')
  
  // Credentials
  it('should manage primary login credential')
  it('should handle multiple active credentials')
  it('should maintain credential history')
})
```

#### Authentication
```typescript
describe('Authentication', () => {
  // Multi-Provider Auth
  it('should authenticate with password')
  it('should authenticate with OAuth tokens')
  it('should validate Apple identity tokens')
  it('should link multiple providers to same user')
  
  // Token Management
  it('should handle OAuth token refresh')
  it('should manage Apple authorization codes')
  it('should track token expiration')
  it('should handle revoked OAuth access')
})
```

### 5. Data Isolation
Tests ensuring proper access control.

#### Security Boundaries
```typescript
describe('Data Isolation', () => {
  // Organization Access
  it('should restrict data access to organization members')
  it('should isolate user data between organizations')
  it('should maintain user-specific settings within organization')
  
  // System Settings
  it('should restrict provider management to system admin')
  it('should allow system admin to view organizations')
})
```

### 6. Template Features
Tests covering template customization capabilities.

#### Customization
```typescript
describe('Template Features', () => {
  // Branding
  it('should support custom organization themes')
  it('should allow logo customization')
  it('should support custom domains')
  
  // Features
  it('should enable/disable template features')
  it('should support organization-specific extensions')
  it('should maintain feature configuration')
})
```

## Test Implementation Priority

1. **Core Authentication Flow**
   - Password-based authentication
   - OAuth2 providers (Google, GitHub)
   - Apple Sign-in
   - Credential management

2. **Basic User Management**
   - User registration
   - Profile management
   - Multiple credentials

3. **Organization Support**
   - Organization creation
   - Member management
   - Basic feature access
   - User preferences

4. **System Administration**
   - Provider management
   - Organization oversight

## Test Data Strategy

### Factory Requirements
- `LoginProviderFactory`: Basic provider types (password, OAuth, Apple)
- `LoginCredentialFactory`: Provider-specific credentials
- `BaseUserFactory`: Core user data
- `OrganizationFactory`: Organization with member management
- `UserFactory`: User data with optional organization

### Test Data Considerations
1. Provider configurations must exist before user registration
2. BaseUser + LoginCredential creation must be atomic
3. Organizations are optional for users
4. Organizations track their members
5. OAuth/Apple credentials need mock tokens

### Future Considerations
- Billing and subscription features will be added later
- Organization size limits may be tied to subscriptions
- Additional organization features may be gated by subscription level
