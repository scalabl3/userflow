# Mock Data Design Standards

## Overview
This document outlines the standards for creating and maintaining mock data used in testing across all layers of the application.

## Structure

### Base Mock Standards
- One mock file per entity
- Support both model and DTO testing
- Maintain relationships between mocks
- Provide consistent test data

### Mock Categories
- Model Mocks: For testing model behavior
- DTO Mocks: For testing API contracts
- Service Mocks: For testing business logic
- Integration Mocks: For testing across layers

### Data Requirements
- Use realistic but sanitized data
- Cover edge cases and variations
- Maintain referential integrity
- Include required/optional fields

### Relationship Handling
- Mock parent/child relationships
- Handle circular references
- Support many-to-many relationships
- Maintain consistency across mocks

### Factory Functions
- Provide customization options
- Use sensible defaults
- Support partial mocks
- Handle complex scenarios

### Testing Support
- Support unit tests
- Enable integration tests
- Facilitate e2e testing
- Allow performance testing
