# Service Layer Design Standards

## Overview
This document outlines the standards for the service layer, which implements business logic and manages interactions between controllers and models.

## Structure

### Base Service Standards
- One service class per entity/domain concept
- Implement standard CRUD operations
- Handle business logic and validation
- Manage relationships and cascading operations

### Method Standards
- Use clear, descriptive method names
- Return types should be explicit
- Handle errors consistently
- Document complex operations

### Business Logic
- Validate input data
- Enforce business rules
- Handle state transitions
- Manage complex operations

### Error Handling
- Use custom exceptions
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle edge cases
- Maintain error consistency

### Transaction Management
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Handle rollbacks appropriately
- Ensure data consistency
- Document transaction boundaries

### Dependency Injection
- Follow IoC principles
- Document required dependencies
- Handle circular dependencies
- Use appropriate scope
