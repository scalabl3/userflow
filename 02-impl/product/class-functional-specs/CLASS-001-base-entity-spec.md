# BaseEntity

## RELATIONSHIPS
### Is-A Relationships

- BaseEntity is the root class for all major entities
  - User is-a BaseEntity (with authentication and profile capabilities)
  - Organization is-a BaseEntity (with member management)
  - Role is-a BaseEntity (with permission sets)
  - Subscription is-a BaseEntity (with billing capabilities)

### Has-A Relationships

BaseEntity has core properties that all derived classes inherit:
- id: UUID
- created_at: DateTime  
- updated_at: DateTime
- deleted_at: DateTime?

### Class Hierarchy

### Related Entities

Purpose: Serve as the foundation class for all major domain entities
- Cardinality: N/A (base class)
- Direction: Inherited by child classes

## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Purpose
BaseEntity serves as the foundational class for all major entities in the system, providing common fields and behaviors for identification, timestamps, and soft deletion. It establishes consistent patterns that all derived classes follow.

### 1.2 Business Value
1. CONSISTENCY: Ensures all entities have standardized identification and tracking
2. AUDITABILITY: Provides creation and modification timestamps for all records
3. DATA_INTEGRITY: Enables soft deletion to maintain referential history
4. SCALABILITY: Standardizes entity patterns for system growth

### 1.3 Primary Use Cases
1. ENTITY_CREATION: System needs to create a new entity with guaranteed unique ID
2. MODIFICATION_TRACKING: System needs to track when entities are modified
3. SOFT_DELETION: System needs to mark entities as deleted while preserving data

## 2. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION

### 2.1 Properties

PROPERTY: id
- Type: UUID
- Access: public read-only
- Description: Unique identifier for the entity
- Initial Value: System-generated UUID

PROPERTY: created_at
- Type: DateTime
- Access: public read-only
- Description: Timestamp when entity was created
- Initial Value: Current timestamp at creation

PROPERTY: updated_at
- Type: DateTime
- Access: public read-only
- Description: Timestamp of last modification
- Initial Value: Same as created_at

PROPERTY: deleted_at
- Type: DateTime?
- Access: public read-only
- Description: Timestamp when entity was soft deleted
- Initial Value: null

### 2.2 Constructor

CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMETERS:
1. None - System generates required values

CONSTRUCTOR_BEHAVIOR:
1. Generate new UUID for id
2. Set created_at to current timestamp
3. Set updated_at to same as created_at
4. Initialize deleted_at as null

### 2.3 Static Methods

METHOD: isValidId
- Parameters:
  1. id: UUID - ID to validate
- Returns: boolean
- Purpose: Validate if an ID matches required format
- Validation:
  1. Must be valid UUID format
  2. Must not be null or empty

### 2.4 Instance Methods

METHOD: markDeleted
- Parameters: none
- Returns: void
- Purpose: Soft delete the entity
- Business Rules:
  1. Can only be deleted if not already deleted
  2. Sets deleted_at to current timestamp

METHOD: restore
- Parameters: none
- Returns: void
- Purpose: Restore a soft-deleted entity
- Business Rules:
  1. Can only restore if currently deleted
  2. Resets deleted_at to null
  3. Updates updated_at timestamp

METHOD: touch
- Parameters: none
- Returns: void
- Purpose: Update the updated_at timestamp
- Business Rules:
  1. Cannot modify deleted entities

## 3. VALIDATION RULES

RULE_CATEGORY: ID_VALIDATION
- Pattern: UUID v4
- Requirements:
  1. Must be valid UUID format
  2. Must be unique within system
  3. Must be immutable once set

RULE_CATEGORY: TIMESTAMP_VALIDATION
- Pattern: ISO 8601 DateTime
- Requirements:
  1. created_at must not be null
  2. updated_at must not be null
  3. updated_at must be >= created_at
  4. deleted_at must be > created_at if set

## 4. TESTING REQUIREMENTS

TEST: Creation
- Scenario: New entity is created
- Expected: Has valid UUID and timestamps

TEST: Deletion
- Scenario: Entity is soft deleted
- Expected: deleted_at is set, data preserved

TEST: Restoration
- Scenario: Deleted entity is restored
- Expected: deleted_at is null, other data unchanged

TEST: Modification Tracking
- Scenario: Entity is modified
- Expected: updated_at reflects change time

## 5. DEPENDENCIES

DEPENDENCY: UUID Generator
- Purpose: Generate unique IDs
- Type: System Service
- Relationship: Used in constructor

DEPENDENCY: DateTime Service
- Purpose: Provide consistent timestamps
- Type: System Service
- Relationship: Used for all timestamps

## 6. SECURITY

REQUIREMENT: ID Immutability
- Description: Entity IDs cannot be modified after creation
- Implementation: Private setter, readonly property

REQUIREMENT: Timestamp Integrity
- Description: Timestamps must be system-generated
- Implementation: Private setters, controlled methods

## 7. ERROR HANDLING

ERROR: InvalidIdError
- Condition: Invalid UUID format or null ID
- Handling: Throw validation error
- Prevention: Validate in constructor

ERROR: InvalidOperationError
- Condition: Operation on deleted entity
- Handling: Throw operation error
- Prevention: Check deleted_at before operations

## 8. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS & IDEAS

IMPROVEMENT_IDEA: Versioning
- Idea: Add version tracking for entities
- Benefits:
  1. Track change history
  2. Enable rollback capabilities
- Implications:
  1. Additional storage requirements
  2. More complex update logic
- User Story: "As a system admin, I want to track entity versions so that I can audit changes"
- Rationale: Enables better auditing and recovery
- Potential Drawbacks:
  1. Risk: Performance impact
     - Impact: MEDIUM
     - Mitigation: Efficient storage strategy
  2. Risk: Complexity increase
     - Impact: LOW
     - Mitigation: Clear version management rules
- Projected Dependencies:
  1. Technical Dependencies:
     - Systems: Version storage system
     - Libraries: Versioning framework
     - APIs: Version management endpoints
  2. Resource Dependencies:
     - Skills: Version management expertise
     - Time: 2-3 sprints
     - Team: 2 developers
  3. Business Dependencies:
     - Stakeholders: Data compliance team
     - Budget: Medium investment
     - Timeline: Q3 implementation

## 9. IMPROVEMENTS PARKING LOT
1. IMPROVEMENT_IDEA: Add metadata field for flexible entity attributes
2. IMPROVEMENT_IDEA: Implement entity cloning capability
3. IMPROVEMENT_IDEA: Add entity archiving separate from deletion
