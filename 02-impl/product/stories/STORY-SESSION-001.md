# Session Management Stories

## Story Relationships
1. STORY-USER-001 (Authentication)
   - Provides: User identity for session creation
   - Required by: All session management
   - Enhances: Login/logout experience

2. STORY-USER-003 (Security Management)
   - Provides: Security policies for sessions
   - Uses: Session monitoring for device management
   - Enhances: Account security

3. STORY-AUTH-UI-001 (Auth UI)
   - Consumes: Session state
   - Displays: Session notifications
   - Required by: All session UI features

4. STORY-ADMIN-UI-001 (System Admin)
   - Uses: Session data for system monitoring
   - Required for: System-wide session management

## Epic: Session Management
As a user
I want my sessions to be properly managed
So that I can access the system securely across devices

## STORY-SESSION-001: Session Lifecycle
As a user
I want clear session management
So that I can understand and control my access state

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Given I start a new session
   When I log in successfully
   Then I should:
   - See my session status (active, time remaining)
   - Know when my session will expire
   - Understand how to extend my session
   And work securely

2. Given my session is ending
   When timeout approaches
   Then I should:
   - Get a warning notification
   - Have option to extend session
   - Be prompted to save work
   And avoid data loss

3. Given my session expires
   When I need to continue working
   Then I should:
   - See clear relogin prompt
   - Maintain my work context
   - Return to previous location after login
   And resume work smoothly

## STORY-SESSION-002: Device Management
As a user
I want to manage my active sessions
So that I can maintain account security

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Given I view my account security
   When I check active sessions
   Then I should:
   - See list of active devices/sessions
   - Identify my current device
   - View basic session details (time, location)
   And understand my account access

2. Given I find suspicious access
   When I manage sessions
   Then I should:
   - Be able to end any session
   - Have option to end all sessions
   - Get confirmation of actions
   And maintain account security

### Technical Notes

### Core Requirements
- Secure session lifecycle
  - Token management
  - Configurable timeouts
  - State preservation
- Basic device tracking
  - Active session list
  - Session termination
  - Device identification

### Implementation Constraints
- Must use secure session tokens
- Must have reasonable timeout defaults
- Must preserve essential work state
- Must log security-relevant actions
