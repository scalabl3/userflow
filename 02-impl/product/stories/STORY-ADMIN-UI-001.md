## Epic: System Administration
As a system administrator
I want to manage and monitor the entire platform
So that I can ensure proper operation and support all users/organizations

Note: System administration is distinct from organization administration (defined in STORY-RBAC-001).
System administrators manage the entire platform, while organization admins manage their specific organization.

### STORY-ADMIN-UI-001: System Dashboard
As a system administrator
I want a clear system-wide dashboard
So that I can monitor overall platform health and usage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I access the system dashboard
   When I view system metrics
   Then I should see:
   - Total user count with active/inactive status
   - Total organization count with feature status
   - Recent registrations with timestamp and type
   - System health indicators with real-time status
   And data should auto-refresh every 30 seconds

2. Given I analyze platform usage
   When I view trends
   Then I should see:
   - System-wide activity metrics (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Resource usage patterns with thresholds
   - Performance indicators with historical data
   And identify potential issues early

### STORY-ADMIN-UI-002: User & Organization Management
As a system administrator
I want to manage all users and organizations
So that I can provide effective system-wide support

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I manage the system
   When I view users/organizations
   Then I should see:
   - All user accounts with status and org affiliation
   - All organizations with feature flags and member count
   - Account/subscription status with expiry dates
   And manage them effectively

2. Given I support a user/organization
   When I access their details
   Then I should:
   - View complete profile and settings
   - See all organization roles and permissions
   - Manage account status and feature flags
   - Reset critical items (password, 2FA, etc.)
   And maintain privacy/security

### STORY-ADMIN-UI-003: System Audit Log
As a system administrator
I want a comprehensive audit log
So that I can track and investigate system-wide activities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I review system logs
   When I view activities
   Then I should see:
   - All system-wide actions with timestamps
   - User/org context with IDs and names
   - Action details with before/after states
   - Affected resources with clear identifiers
   And understand platform usage patterns

2. Given I investigate issues
   When I search audit logs
   Then I should:
   - Filter by date, user, org, action type
   - Export filtered results as CSV
   - See related events in sequence
   And resolve problems efficiently

### Technical Notes

### Core Requirements
- System Dashboard
  - Real-time platform-wide metrics
  - Health monitoring with thresholds
  - Usage analytics with trends
  - Auto-refresh mechanism
- User/Organization Management
  - Complete user/org data access
  - Feature flag management
  - Support action logging
  - Privacy controls
- Audit Logging
  - Comprehensive activity tracking
  - Advanced search/filter
  - Export capabilities
  - Data retention rules

### Implementation Constraints
- Must enforce system admin access only
- Must log all admin actions with detail
- Must protect sensitive user/org data
- Must handle large datasets efficiently
- Must support white-labeling
- Must separate from org admin interface

Note: While focused on sites under 10K users, system administration requires 
comprehensive tools for effective platform management. Core features should
be complete but UI can be simple.
