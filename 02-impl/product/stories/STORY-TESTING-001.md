## Epic: Essential Testing
As a developer
I want basic testing tools
So that I can ensure core features work

### STORY-TESTING-001: Basic Testing
As a developer
I want simple test setup
So that I can verify key functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I write tests
   When implementing features
   Then I should have:
   - Jest for unit tests
   - React Testing Library
   - Basic API tests
   And cover essentials

2. Given I run tests
   When checking code
   Then I should:
   - Run npm test
   - See pass/fail
   - Get error details
   And fix issues

### STORY-TESTING-002: Test Examples
As a developer
I want clear examples
So that I can write tests efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I need guidance
   When writing tests
   Then I should have:
   - Auth test example
   - API test example
   - UI test example
   And follow patterns

2. Given I add features
   When testing new code
   Then I should:
   - Use examples
   - Test core paths
   - Keep it simple
   And work efficiently

### Technical Notes

### Core Requirements
- Essential tools
  - Jest configuration
  - Testing Library setup
  - API test helpers
- Basic patterns
  - Auth testing
  - API testing
  - UI testing

### Implementation Constraints
- Must use Jest
- Must test auth
- Must test API
- Must run in CI
- Must be quick

Note: Focus is on essential testing for sites under 10K users.
Complex test scenarios can be added as sites grow.
