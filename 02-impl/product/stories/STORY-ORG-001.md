## Epic: Organization Management
As a user of the site
I want to use organization features when they're available to my account
So that I can collaborate with others effectively

Note: Every user has an organization (visible or not) and is automatically assigned 
as its Admin. Organization visibility and collaboration features depend on 
subscription/system settings.

2. Given I have a basic account
   When organization features are disabled
   Then I should:
   - Still have my organization (not visible)
   - Maintain Admin role

## STORY-ORG-003: Member Management
As an organization admin
