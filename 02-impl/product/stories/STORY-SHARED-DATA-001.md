# Shared Data Stories

## Story Relationships
1. STORY-USER-001 (Authentication)
   - Provides: User model
   - Required by: Core data types
   - Enhances: Type safety

2. STORY-ORG-001 (Organization)
   - Provides: Organization model
   - Required by: Data relationships
   - Enhances: Data structure

3. STORY-RBAC-001 (Role Management)
   - Provides: Role types
   - Required by: Access control
   - Enhances: Data security

4. STORY-API-001 (API Structure)
   - Provides: API patterns
   - Required by: Data operations
   - Enhances: Data access

## Epic: Essential Data Types
As a developer
I want simple data management
So that I can build features quickly

### STORY-SHARED-DATA-001: Core Types
As a developer
I want basic type definitions
So that I can work with data safely

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I need data types
   When building features
   Then I should have:
   - User type
   - Organization type
   - Role enum
   And maintain consistency

2. Given I use these types
   When coding features
   Then I should:
   - Get type checking
   - Have Prisma models
   - See relationships
   And work efficiently

### STORY-SHARED-DATA-002: Data Access
As a developer
I want simple data operations
So that I can manage data reliably

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I need data
   When building features
   Then I should have:
   - Basic CRUD
   - Type safety
   - Error handling
   And maintain integrity

2. Given I query data
   When implementing features
   Then I should:
   - Get typed results
   - Handle basic filters
   - Support pagination
   And work efficiently

### Technical Notes

### Core Requirements
- Essential types
  - User model
  - Organization model
  - Role types
  - Basic relationships
- Simple operations
  - CRUD functions
  - Type checking
  - Error handling

### Implementation Constraints
- Must use Prisma
- Must be type-safe
- Must handle errors
- Must be testable
- Must be simple

Note: Focus is on essential data handling for sites under 10K users.
Complex data patterns can be added as sites grow.
