## Epic: API Foundation
As a development team
I want a consistent, well-documented, and extensible API structure
So that I can build and maintain reliable services

### STORY-API-001: Core API Structure
As an API developer
I want standardized API patterns
So that I can build consistent and maintainable endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am developing endpoints
   When I follow API standards
   Then I should have:
   - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
   - Standard error responses
   - RESTful URL patterns
   - Type definitions
   And maintain consistency

2. Given I implement authentication
   When I create protected endpoints
   Then I should have:
   - Standard auth middleware
   - Role-based access checks
   - Token validation
   And maintain security

3. Given I handle responses
   When I return data
   Then I should follow:
   - Consistent response formats
   - Standard error structures
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   And maintain type safety

### STORY-API-002: API Documentation
As an API consumer
I want clear API documentation
So that I can use the API effectively

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I read documentation
   When I view any endpoint
   Then I should see:
   - Clear descriptions
   - Request/response schemas
   - Authentication requirements
   - Usage examples
   And understand the API

2. Given I use the API
   When I make requests
   Then I should have:
   - Interactive testing
   - Clear validation
   - Type definitions
   And work efficiently

### STORY-API-003: API Version Management
As an API maintainer
I want clear version management
So that I can evolve the API while maintaining compatibility

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am updating the API
   When I make changes
   Then I should:
   - Follow semantic versioning
   - Maintain backwards compatibility
   - Document changes clearly
   - Update OpenAPI specs
   And clients should be notified of changes

2. Given I need to make breaking changes
   When I implement them
   Then I should:
   - Create new versions
   - Maintain old versions temporarily
   - Document migration paths
   And provide clear upgrade guidance

### STORY-API-004: API Extension Patterns
As an application developer
I want clear patterns for extending the base API
So that I can add application-specific endpoints while maintaining consistency

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am building upon the base API
   When I add new application-specific endpoints
   Then I should have:
   - Clear extension points
   - Base middleware hooks
   - Standard error handling
   - Documentation templates
   And my extensions should feel native to the framework

2. Given I am customizing authentication
   When I add new auth requirements
   Then I should be able to:
   - Extend base auth middleware
   - Add custom validation rules
   - Integrate new providers
   - Maintain type safety
   And security standards should be preserved

3. Given I am adding custom business logic
   When I implement new endpoints
   Then I should have:
   - Access to core utilities
   - Type generation tools
   - Testing patterns
   - Documentation generation
   And the development experience should be consistent

### Technical Notes

### Core Requirements
- OpenAPI/Swagger implementation
- Standard REST patterns
- Authentication middleware
- Error handling standards
- Response formatting
- Type definitions
- Documentation generation

### Implementation Constraints
- Must document all endpoints
- Must validate authentication
- Must follow response standards
- Must handle errors properly
- Must define strict types
- Must generate documentation
- Must standardize security
