# Role and Permission Management Stories

## Story Relationships
1. STORY-USER-001 (Authentication)
   - Provides: User identity
   - Required by: Initial role assignment
   - Creates: First Admin role

2. STORY-ORG-001 (Organization)
   - Provides: Organization context
   - Required by: Role assignments
   - Controls: Role visibility

3. STORY-BILLING-001 (Billing)
   - Provides: Feature flags
   - Required by: Role management
   - Controls: Member invitations

4. STORY-ADMIN-UI-001 (System Admin)
   - Provides: System-wide role view
   - Required by: Role monitoring
   - Enhances: Platform management

Note: Roles are always created with organizations, even when not visible.
The organization creator is automatically assigned the Admin role and this
cannot be changed. Other members can only be assigned Member or Viewer roles.

## Epic: Role Management
As an organization admin
I want to assign roles to members
So that I can control access to organization features

### STORY-ROLE-001: Role Assignment
As an organization admin
I want to assign Member or Viewer roles
So that I can control what others can do

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given organization features are enabled
   When I invite members
   Then I should:
   - Assign either Member or Viewer role
   - See current role assignments
   - Get confirmation of changes
   And maintain security

2. Given I review members
   When I view the member list
   Then I should see:
   - Each member's current role
   - Last role change date
   - Who made the change
   And understand access

### STORY-ROLE-002: Role Enforcement
As a team member
I want my role permissions enforced
So that I can work appropriately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am the Admin (creator)
   When I use the system
   Then I should:
   - Manage organization settings
   - Manage member roles
   - Access all features
   And maintain control

2. Given I am a Member
   When I use the system
   Then I should:
   - View all content
   - Create new content
   - Edit unlocked content
   And contribute effectively

3. Given I am a Viewer
   When I use the system
   Then I should:
   - View all content
   - Not see edit options
   - Not see management options
   And maintain read-only access

### Technical Notes

### Core Requirements
- Fixed Role Types
  ```typescript
  enum Role {
    ADMIN,    // Organization creator only
    MEMBER,   // Can create/edit content
    VIEWER    // Read-only access
  }
  ```

- Role Assignment
  - Admin role fixed to creator
  - Members can be Member or Viewer
  - Log all role changes

- Access Control
  - Simple role checks
  - Fixed permissions per role
  - Clear boundaries

### Implementation Constraints
- Must assign Admin to creator
- Must protect Admin role
- Must log role changes
- Must enforce role permissions
- Must support feature flags

# =====================================================
# SCOPE BOUNDARY - Base Implementation Ends Here
# =====================================================

Note: Content locking is handled at the content level, not through roles.
Organization features may be hidden based on subscription/settings, but roles
are always maintained in the data model.
