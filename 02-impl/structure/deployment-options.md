# Deployment Options

## Overview
This document outlines deployment options for our monorepo structure, focusing on simplicity and effectiveness for testing and development.

## Primary Options

### 1. Vercel (Recommended for Initial Testing)
- Perfect integration with Next.js applications
- Features:
  - Zero-configuration deployments
  - Automatic branch previews
  - Built-in CI/CD pipeline
  - Native monorepo support with project detection
- Benefits:
  - Generous free tier for testing
  - Automatic HTTPS
  - Edge network deployment
  - Instant rollbacks

### 2. GitHub Actions + Netlify/Vercel
- More customizable pipeline approach
- Features:
  - Fine-grained control over build and test steps
  - Monorepo support via workflow triggers
  - Selective deployments based on folder changes
- Benefits:
  - More control over the deployment process
  - Can integrate additional testing/validation steps
  - Flexible configuration options

### 3. Railway
- Alternative to Vercel
- Features:
  - Simple deployment process
  - Built-in monorepo support
  - Automatic deployments
- Benefits:
  - Good free tier
  - Simple configuration
  - Quick setup

### 4. Local Testing Options
- Simplest approach for development
- Options:
  - Basic: `npm run build && npm start`
  - Docker: Containerized environment
  - Kubernetes: Local cluster (minikube/k3s)
- Benefits:
  - No infrastructure overhead
  - Quick iteration
  - Full control over environment

## Recommended Approach

For our current template application, we recommend a two-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Local Development
- Use simple local testing with `npm run build && npm start`
- Focus on core functionality and features
- Minimal infrastructure overhead
- Quick iteration cycles

### Phase 2: Online Testing (Optional)
- Deploy to Vercel for online testing
- Benefits:
  - Minimal setup required
  - Automatic preview deployments
  - Easy rollbacks
  - Production-like environment

## Future Considerations
- Scaling requirements
- CI/CD pipeline expansion
- Environment management
- Monitoring and logging
- Cost optimization
