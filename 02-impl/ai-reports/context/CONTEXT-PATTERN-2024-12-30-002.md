# Context Pattern Report

## Report Information
- Type: Context
- ID: CONTEXT-PATTERN-2024-12-30-002
- Status: Final
- Priority: High

## Pattern Definition
- Category: Template Adherence
- Trigger: Self-assessment creation without baseline review
- Impact: Documentation quality and standard maintenance
- Scope: All document creation processes

## Context State
Primary: Analysis of template deviation pattern
Dependencies: 
- Self-assessment templates
- Documentation standards
- Human-AI communication patterns

## Pattern Analysis
Sequence:
1. Memory-based execution without verification
2. Human provides indirect guidance
3. Recognition of verification requirement
4. Pattern correction and documentation

Root Causes:
- Overconfidence in memory retention
- Prioritizing speed over verification
- Incomplete context loading

Impact Chain:
Documentation inconsistency → Standard erosion → Increased maintenance cost

## Management Protocol
Prevention:
- Enforce "read before write"
- Verify baseline documents
- Track template relationships

Detection:
- Template compliance checks
- Structure verification gates
- Pattern deviation monitors

Recovery:
1. Stop execution
2. Review baselines
3. Verify structure
4. Document learning

## Meta Analysis
Learning Points:
- Effective response to indirect guidance
- Pattern recognition improvement
- Enhanced verification awareness

Evolution Markers:
- From memory-based to verification-based
- From reactive to proactive checking
- From implicit to explicit adherence
