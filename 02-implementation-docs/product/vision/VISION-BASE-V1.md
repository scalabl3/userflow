# Product Vision: Base Application Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the vision for a modern web application foundation that provides essential building blocks for creating reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications. The framework emphasizes clean implementation of core functionality needed by any modern interactive website, while maintaining flexibility for natural growth.

### Framework Scope & Intent
This framework is designed to serve as a foundation for modern web applications. Applications built using this will have additional vision, stories, strategies, tactics, design and todo/tasks tailored specifically to the particular app requirements. Those will focus more on product/market fit, identifying more user specifics, and extended functionality based on the individual needs of that website/application/brand.

The framework provides the common infrastructure that modern web applications need, allowing teams to focus on their unique value proposition rather than rebuilding standard functionality. This reuseable base application is more of a functional framework with the following characteristics:

1. **User & Organization Model**
   - Individual users, each with a shadow organization
   - Small organizations (typically 2-10 users)
   - Flexible transition between individual and organization modes
   - Focus on organic, natural growth patterns

2. **Modern Authentication & Billing**
   - Support for contemporary authentication methods (OAuth2, Apple Login, etc.)
   - Integration with modern payment services (Stripe, Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.)
   - Emphasis on standard security practices and user convenience

3. **Development Philosophy**
   - Clean, maintainable implementation over complex architecture
   - Focus on core functionality common to modern web applications
   - Clear extension patterns for specific business needs
   - Reliable, well-tested building blocks

4. **Scale & Performance**
   - Optimized for thousands of individual users
   - Support for hundreds of small organizations
   - Emphasis on reliability and consistent performance
   - Room for natural growth without over-engineering

## Target Users
1. **Development Teams**
   - Small to medium-sized development teams
   - Focus on feature development rather than infrastructure
   - Need reliable, well-tested building blocks

2. **Organizations**
   - Small teams and businesses (typically 2-10 users)
   - Need professional features without enterprise complexity
   - Value reliability and ease of use

3. **System Administrators**

   - Configuring system settings
   - Monitoring system health

4. **End Users**
   - Individual users (each with shadow organization)
   - Members of small organizations
   - Expect modern, responsive interface

## Core Value Proposition
