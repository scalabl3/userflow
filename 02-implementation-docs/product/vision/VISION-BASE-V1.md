# Product Vision: Base Application Framework

## Overview
A comprehensive, reusable foundation for modern web applications that provides essential business and user management functionality. This base framework includes organization management, user authentication, role-based access control, billing integration, and a clear separation between public marketing, API services, and authenticated user interfaces.

## Target Users

### Primary
- **Development Teams**
  - Need a robust starting point for new applications
  - Want to avoid rebuilding common functionality
  - Require flexible integration points for custom features

- **Organizations (Tenants)**
  - Need to manage their users and permissions
  - Want to handle billing and subscriptions
  - Require secure access control

### Secondary
- **System Administrators**
  - Need to manage multiple organizations
  - Want to monitor system health
  - Require advanced troubleshooting capabilities

- **End Users**
  - Need secure authentication
  - Want intuitive user interfaces
  - Require role-appropriate access
