# Authenticated Interface Stories

## Epic: Application Interface Template
As a developer
I want a base authenticated interface structure
So that I can build specific application interfaces upon it

### STORY-AUTH-UI-001: Core Application Shell
As an authenticated user
I want a consistent, functional application structure
So that I can access and use protected features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am authenticated
   When I access the application
   Then I should see:
   - Main navigation structure
   - User profile/settings area
   - Content region layout
   - Notification area
   And maintain authenticated state

2. Given I am using the application
   When I navigate between sections
   Then I should have:
   - Consistent layout structure
   - Loading state handling
   - Error boundary protection
   - State preservation
   And maintain smooth transitions

3. Given I am managing my account
   When I access user features
   Then I should see:
   - Profile management area
   - Settings configuration
   - Notification preferences
   - Session management
   And maintain security context

## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- Authentication state management
- Protected route structure
- Base layout system
- Navigation framework
- Error boundaries
- Loading states
- State management
- Extension points

System-wide Constraints:
- Authentication required
- Session management
- State persistence
- Security headers
- Route protection
- Type safety
- Error handling
- Performance baseline

Implementation Requirements:
- Auth flow integration
- Layout framework
- Navigation system
- State containers
- Error handling
- Loading patterns
- Extension system
- Security setup

### Extension Patterns
- Content region injection
- Navigation customization
- State management hooks
- Layout modification
- Theme system
- Plugin architecture
- Security extension
- Analytics hooks

### Implementation Guidelines for AI Collaboration
- Clear auth boundaries
- State management patterns
- Extension documentation
- Security implementation
- Performance baselines
- Component structure
- Route organization
- Plugin system

# =====================================================
# SCOPE BOUNDARY - Base Implementation Ends Here
# =====================================================
# The following section describes features that are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE
# for the base template implementation. These are documented for awareness and future
# extension possibilities only.

### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
- Advanced state management
- Complex layouts
- Custom navigation
