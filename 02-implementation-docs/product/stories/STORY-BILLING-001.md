   - Enable/disable providers (Stripe, Apple Pay, etc.)
   - Set API keys securely
   - Configure webhooks
   And start accepting payments

2. Given providers are configured
   When I check status
   Then I should see:
   - Active providers

   And monitor health

### STORY-BILLING-002: Payment Processing

   Then they should:
   - See available payment methods
   - Use secure payment forms

   And complete transactions safely
