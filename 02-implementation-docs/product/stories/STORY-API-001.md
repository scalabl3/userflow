# API Structure and Standards Stories

## Epic: API Foundation
As a development team
I want a consistent, well-documented, and extensible API structure
So that I can build and maintain reliable services that can be extended for specific applications

### STORY-API-001: Core API Structure
As an API developer
I want standardized API patterns and documentation
So that I can build consistent and maintainable endpoints

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am developing a new API endpoint
   When I follow the API standards
   Then I should have:
   - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
   - Standard error responses
   - Consistent URL patterns
   - Type definitions
   And the documentation should be machine-readable

2. Given I am implementing authentication
   When I create protected endpoints
   Then I should have:
   - Standard auth middleware
   - Role-based access checks
   - Token validation
   - Clear error messages
   And all security measures should be consistently applied

3. Given I am handling API responses
   When I return data
   Then I should follow:
   - Consistent response formats
   - Standard error structures
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - Clear success/error messages
   And responses should be properly typed

4. Given I am extending the base API
   When I add custom endpoints
   Then I should:
   - Follow established patterns
   - Maintain documentation standards
   - Use existing middleware
   - Keep consistent structure
   And new endpoints should integrate seamlessly

### STORY-API-002: API Documentation Standards
As an API consumer
I want comprehensive and consistent API documentation
So that I can understand and use the API effectively

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am viewing the API documentation
   When I look at any endpoint
   Then I should see:
   - Clear endpoint descriptions
   - Request/response schemas
   - Authentication requirements
   - Example requests/responses
   And documentation should be always in sync with implementation

2. Given I am using the API
   When I make requests
   Then I should have:
   - Interactive testing capability
   - Clear validation messages
   - Type definitions
   - Generated client code
   And the experience should be consistent across endpoints

3. Given I am extending the API
   When I add new features
   Then I should:
   - Generate updated documentation
   - Maintain type definitions
   - Update client code
   - Preserve existing patterns
   And changes should be automatically reflected

4. Given I am troubleshooting
   When I encounter issues
   Then I should have:
   - Clear error messages
   - Debug information
   - Request validation details
   - Logging standards
   And issues should be easy to diagnose

### STORY-API-003: API Version Management
As an API maintainer
I want clear version management
So that I can evolve the API while maintaining compatibility

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am updating the API
   When I make changes
   Then I should:
   - Follow semantic versioning
   - Maintain backwards compatibility
   - Document changes clearly
   - Update OpenAPI specs
   And clients should be notified of changes

2. Given I need to make breaking changes
   When I implement them
   Then I should:
   - Create new versions
   - Maintain old versions
   - Migrate clients gradually
   - Document migration paths
   And both versions should work simultaneously

3. Given I am deprecating features
   When I mark them as deprecated
   Then I should:
   - Notify users
   - Provide alternatives
   - Set deprecation timelines
   - Monitor usage
   And give clients time to migrate

4. Given I am supporting multiple versions
   When clients make requests
   Then I should:
   - Route to correct version
   - Maintain consistent patterns
   - Track version usage
   - Handle errors appropriately
   And support graceful degradation

## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- OpenAPI/Swagger implementation
- Standard REST patterns
- Consistent endpoint structure
- Authentication middleware
- Error handling standards
- Response formatting
- Request validation
- Type definitions
- Version management
- Documentation generation

System-wide Constraints:
- All endpoints must be documented
- Authentication must be consistent
- Responses must follow standards
- Errors must be properly handled
- Types must be strictly defined
- Versions must be clearly marked
- Documentation must be automated
- Security must be standardized

Implementation Requirements:
- OpenAPI/Swagger tooling
- Type generation system
- Authentication framework
- Validation middleware
- Error handling middleware
- Documentation automation
- Version routing
- Testing framework

### Extension Patterns
- Custom endpoint registration
- Middleware injection points
- Response transformation hooks
- Error handler customization
- Documentation extensions
- Version management hooks
- Authentication customization
- Validation rule extension

### Implementation Guidelines for AI Collaboration
- Keep endpoint logic isolated and documented
- Use clear interface boundaries
- Document all extension points
- Maintain consistent naming
- Use types effectively
- Mark security-critical code
- Separate config from logic
- Document common patterns
