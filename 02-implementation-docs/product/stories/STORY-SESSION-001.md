# Session Management Stories

## Epic: Session Management and Security
As a user of the system
I want my sessions to be securely managed across devices
So that my account remains protected while maintaining convenient access

### STORY-SESSION-001: Core Session Management
As a system administrator
I want to configure and manage session policies
So that I can ensure secure and appropriate session handling for my users

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am configuring the application
   When I access session management settings
   Then I should be able to configure:
   - Session timeout periods (default 30 minutes)
   - Maximum concurrent sessions per user
   - Session extension policies
   - Forced logout policies
   And changes should require administrative approval

2. Given I am setting up session policies
   When I configure timeouts
   Then I should be able to set different timeouts for:
   - Regular user sessions
   - Administrative sessions
   - API token sessions
   And each should have appropriate minimum/maximum bounds

3. Given a session is approaching timeout
   When the user is actively using the system
   Then they should:
   - Receive a warning notification
   - Have the option to extend their session
   - Not lose any unsaved work
   And the extension should be logged for audit

4. Given a session has timed out
   When the user attempts to continue
   Then they should:
   - Be redirected to login
   - Have their session state preserved
   - Be able to resume after re-authentication
   And the timeout should be logged for audit

### STORY-SESSION-002: Device Management
As a user
I want to manage my active sessions across devices
So that I can maintain security and control access

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am logged in
   When I view my active sessions
   Then I should see for each session:
   - Device information
   - Location data
   - Login timestamp
   - Last activity time
   And be able to terminate any session

2. Given I have multiple active sessions
   When I terminate a session
   Then that session should end immediately
   And the user of that session should be notified
   And the action should be logged for audit

3. Given I want to manage trusted devices
   When I access device settings
   Then I should be able to:
   - View all devices that have connected
   - Mark devices as trusted/untrusted
   - Set per-device session policies
   - Remove devices from the trusted list

4. Given I log in from a new device
   When the system detects it's unrecognized
   Then I should receive:
   - A notification on my primary device
   - An email alert
   - Option to approve/deny the new device
   And the decision should be recorded

### STORY-SESSION-003: Session State Management
As a user
I want my session state to be properly maintained
So that I can have a seamless experience across interactions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am actively using the system
   When I perform actions
   Then my session state should:
   - Update in real-time
   - Maintain data consistency
   - Handle concurrent operations
   - Preserve user preferences

2. Given I have unsaved changes
   When my session requires re-authentication
   Then the system should:
   - Preserve my working state
   - Allow me to resume after login
   - Maintain data integrity
   - Notify me of any state changes

3. Given I am switching devices
   When I log in on a new device
   Then I should:
   - See my current working state
   - Have access to my preferences
   - Maintain consistent permissions
   And any state changes should sync across devices

4. Given I have multiple tabs open
   When I make changes in one tab
   Then the system should:
   - Maintain consistency across tabs
   - Handle conflicting changes gracefully
   - Notify of updates when needed
   And prevent data corruption

## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- Implement secure session token management
- Support session timeout and extension
- Enable basic device tracking
- Maintain session state consistency
- Support multiple concurrent sessions
- Implement session termination
- Enable session state recovery
- Support basic device recognition

System-wide Constraints:
- Session tokens must be cryptographically secure
- Timeout periods must be configurable but bounded
- Device tracking must respect privacy settings
- State management must handle network issues
- Session data must be securely encrypted
- Concurrent session limits must be enforced
- Device recognition must be privacy-compliant

Implementation Requirements:
- Session token rotation
- Secure token storage
- Timeout management
- Basic device fingerprinting
- State serialization
- Concurrent session handling
- Audit logging
- Error recovery

### Extension Patterns
- Each requirement should have clear extension points
- Session token management should support custom token enrichment
- Device tracking should allow additional data collection
- State management should support custom state types
- Audit logging should allow custom event types
- All core features should be overridable with custom implementations

### Implementation Guidelines for AI Collaboration
- Keep core session logic isolated and well-documented
- Use clear interface boundaries for extensible components
- Document extension points with examples
- Maintain consistent naming patterns for overridable components
- Use type systems effectively to guide implementation
- Keep security-critical code clearly marked
- Separate configuration from core logic
