# Public Marketing Interface Stories

## Epic: Public Site Template
As a developer
I want a base marketing interface structure
So that I can build specific marketing sites upon it

### STORY-MARKETING-UI-001: Core Public Templates
As a site visitor
I want consistent, functional page structures
So that I can navigate and use the base application

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I visit the site
   When I view the home page template
   Then I should see:
   - Content placeholder areas
   - Navigation structure
   - Call-to-action placement
   - Responsive layout
   And have clear path to authentication

2. Given I view other pages
   When I visit about/contact templates
   Then I should see:
   - Consistent layout structure
   - Content placeholder regions
   - Standard component areas
   - Form structures where needed
   And maintain consistent navigation

3. Given I want to authenticate
   When I access auth pages
   Then I should see:
   - Standard form layouts
   - Error handling structure
   - Success flow structure
   - Loading state placeholders
   And be able to navigate the auth flow
