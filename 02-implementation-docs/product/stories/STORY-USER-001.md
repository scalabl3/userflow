# Future Enterprise Authentication Considerations
- Enterprise authentication methods (not implemented in base template):
  - LDAP/Active Directory integration
  - SAML 2.0 support for SSO
  - Kerberos authentication
  - Enterprise identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
  - Custom enterprise authentication protocols
  - JIT (Just-in-Time) provisioning
  - SCIM user provisioning
  - Federated identity management
  - Enterprise MFA integration
  - Directory synchronization
Note: These enterprise features require additional infrastructure and should be considered as extension points rather than base template features.
