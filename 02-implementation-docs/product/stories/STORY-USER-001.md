As a system administrator
I want to configure the registration workflow
So that I can optimize user onboarding based on application needs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am configuring the application
   When I access registration settings
   Then I should be able to select between three registration workflows:
   - Phone + Email workflow (with SMS verification)
   - Email + Password workflow (with email verification)
   - Username + Email + Password workflow (with email verification)
   And only one workflow can be active at a time per application

2. Given I am configuring registration
   When I select a workflow
   Then I should be able to specify which fields are required vs optional
   And set the order of the registration steps
   And configure field validation rules

3. Given I am configuring registration
   When I change the workflow
   Then existing user accounts should remain valid
   And the system should handle mixed authentication methods appropriately
   And users should be notified of new login options

4. Given I am configuring registration
   When I enable a simpler workflow
   Then I should be able to specify a migration plan for adding additional required fields later
   And set deadlines for when fields become mandatory

### STORY-USER-002: Phone + Email Registration

3. Given I enter my phone number
   When I submit the form
   Then I should receive an SMS verification code
   And be prompted to verify my phone number
   And the code should expire after a configurable timeout

4. Given I verify my phone number
   When the verification is successful
   Then I should receive an email confirmation
   And my account should be created
   And email verification status should be tracked separately from phone verification

5. Given my account is created
   When I attempt to log in
   Then I should be able to use either phone number or email
   And 2FA should be automatically enabled using SMS

## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- Implement secure password hashing and storage
- Support multiple authentication workflows
- Maintain audit logs for all authentication attempts
- Implement session management
- Support email verification
- Support SMS verification for phone numbers
- Implement basic 2FA capabilities
- Handle account lockout after failed attempts
- Support password reset workflows
- Maintain user profile data
- Implement basic access control
- Support extensible profile schema for progressive enhancement
- Implement device-aware session management
- Design authentication for multiple 2FA method support

System-wide Constraints:
- User uniqueness is system-wide, not per-organization

- Session security levels are uniform across authentication methods
- User identifiers (email, phone, username) must be unique across the entire system
- Account lockout policies apply globally
- Device tracking is system-wide and persistent
- Profile schema extensions apply globally
- 2FA method availability is system-wide

Implementation Requirements:
- Only basic 2FA methods (SMS/Email) active, but schema supports expansion
- Only standard password-based authentication
- Only email and phone verification
- Basic session management with device awareness
- Standard profile fields with extensible schema
- Core device tracking and management
- Profile completion state tracking

# =====================================================
# SCOPE BOUNDARY - Base Implementation Ends Here
# =====================================================

# for the base template implementation. These are documented for awareness and future
# extension possibilities only.

### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
- Support biometric authentication
- Support multiple active 2FA methods
- Implement advanced device-specific security settings
- Support configurable password policies
- Enable bulk user operations
- Support user activity tracking

# Future Enterprise Authentication Considerations
- Enterprise authentication methods (not implemented in base template):
  - LDAP/Active Directory integration
  - SAML 2.0 support for SSO
  - Kerberos authentication
  - Enterprise identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
  - Custom enterprise authentication protocols
  - JIT (Just-in-Time) provisioning
  - SCIM user provisioning
  - Federated identity management
  - Enterprise MFA integration
  - Directory synchronization
Note: These enterprise features require additional infrastructure and should be considered as extension points rather than base template features.
