# Shared Layer Stories

## Epic: Cross-Package Type Safety
As a developer
I want a shared foundation of types, DTOs, and validation schemas
So that I can maintain consistency and type safety across all packages

### STORY-SHARED-001: Core Type System
As a developer
I want a well-structured shared type system
So that I can ensure consistency between frontend, business logic, and API layers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am developing across packages
   When I need to use shared types
   Then I should have access to:
   - Core domain types
   - Request/Response DTOs
   - Validation schemas
   And maintain type safety

2. Given I am implementing features
   When I use shared utilities
   Then I should have:
   - Type helpers
   - Validation functions
   - Common utilities
   And consistent behavior

3. Given I am extending the system
   When I add new types
   Then I should:
   - Follow established patterns
   - Maintain backwards compatibility
   - Generate appropriate documentation
   And preserve type safety

## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- Type definition structure
- DTO organization
- Validation schemas
- Utility functions
- Documentation generation
- Type safety enforcement
- Version management
- Import/Export patterns

System-wide Constraints:
- TypeScript strict mode
- Consistent naming
- Clear versioning
- Minimal dependencies
- Efficient bundling
- Cross-package access
- Documentation standards
- Testing requirements

Implementation Requirements:
- Type organization
- Build configuration
- Package structure
- Export strategy
- Test framework
- Documentation tools
- Version control
- Distribution method

### Extension Patterns
- Type extension points
- DTO customization
- Schema enhancement
- Utility expansion
- Version management
- Documentation hooks
- Test patterns
- Build processes

### Implementation Guidelines for AI Collaboration
- Type organization
- Naming conventions
- Documentation standards
- Test coverage
- Version management
- Build process
- Distribution
- Extension points

# =====================================================
# SCOPE BOUNDARY - Base Implementation Ends Here
# =====================================================
# The following section describes features that are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE
# for the base template implementation. These are documented for awareness and future
# extension possibilities only.

### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
- Advanced type helpers
- Complex validations
- Extended utilities
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced documentation
- Migration tools
- Testing utilities
- Build enhancements

### Advanced Capabilities (Nice to Have)
- Type generation tools
- Schema validators
- Custom decorators
- Advanced bundling
- Documentation generation
- Migration automation
- Testing frameworks
- Build optimization

# Future Enterprise Administration Considerations

### Data Governance
- Type-level data classification
- Regulatory compliance markers
- PII/sensitive data tracking
- Data lineage through types
- Audit trail integration
- Data retention policies
- Cross-border data rules
- Industry-specific schemas

### Enterprise Integration
- Legacy system type mapping
- EDI format compatibility
- SOAP/XML schema support
- Enterprise ESB integration
- Mainframe data structures
- Industry standard formats
- B2B data exchange types
- Multi-tenant type isolation

### Advanced Security
- Type-level encryption markers
- Zero-trust type validation
- RBAC type constraints
- Data masking rules
- Security classification
- Compliance validation
- Access control patterns
- Audit logging schemas

### Scale Considerations
- Global type distribution
- Multi-region schemas
- Performance profiling
- Load balancing types
- Caching strategies
- Replication patterns
- Sharding support
- High-availability design
