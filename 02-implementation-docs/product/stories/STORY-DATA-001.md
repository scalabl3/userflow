# Data Structure and Operations Stories

## Epic: Core Data Foundation
As a development team
I want standardized data structures and operations
So that all application features have a consistent data foundation to build upon

### STORY-DATA-001: Core Data Structures
As a developer
I want well-defined base data structures
So that I can build features with consistent data patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am working with core entities
   When I need to access their structure
   Then I should have:
   - User data model
   - Organization model
   - Role/Permission models
   - Billing/Subscription models
   - Session/Token models
   And they should be consistently structured

2. Given I am using these models
   When I implement features
   Then I should have:
   - Clear relationships between models
   - Standard timestamps (created/updated)
   - Consistent ID patterns
   - Soft delete support
   And maintain referential integrity

3. Given I need to extend models
   When I add custom fields
   Then I should:
   - Have clear extension points
   - Maintain base properties
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Update relationships
   And preserve data consistency

### STORY-DATA-002: CRUD Operations
As a developer
I want standardized CRUD operations
So that I can consistently manage data across the application

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am implementing CRUD
   When I create operations
   Then I should have:
   - Standard create patterns
   - Consistent read operations
   - Update validations
   - Safe delete handling
   And maintain data integrity

2. Given I am querying data
   When I fetch records
   Then I should support:
   - Filtering
   - Sorting
   - Pagination
   - Eager/lazy loading
   And handle relationships properly

3. Given I am updating records
   When I modify data
   Then I should:
   - Validate changes
   - Handle concurrency
   - Maintain history
   - Update relationships
   And prevent data corruption

4. Given I am deleting records
   When I remove data
   Then I should:
   - Support soft deletes
   - Handle cascading
   - Maintain referential integrity
   - Archive if needed
   And prevent orphaned records

## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- Base entity interfaces
- Standard CRUD operations
- Relationship management
- Data validation
- Concurrency handling
- Audit tracking
- Soft delete support
- Query patterns

System-wide Constraints:
- Consistent ID generation
- Required audit fields
- Relationship integrity
- Data validation rules
- Concurrency checks
- History tracking
- Soft delete by default
- Type safety

Implementation Requirements:
- Base entity classes
- CRUD repositories
- Query builders
- Validation system
- Relationship handlers
- History trackers
- Migration support
- Test fixtures

### Extension Patterns
- Entity inheritance
- Custom field addition
- Validation extension
- Query customization
- Repository overrides
- History customization
- Relationship extension
- Archive strategies

### Implementation Guidelines for AI Collaboration
- Document entity relationships
- Clear validation rules
- Standard query patterns
- Extension point examples
- Error handling patterns
- Migration patterns
- Test case templates
- Performance guidelines

# =====================================================
# SCOPE BOUNDARY - Base Implementation Ends Here
# =====================================================
# The following section describes features that are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE
# for the base template implementation. These are documented for awareness and future
# extension possibilities only.

### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
- Advanced querying
- Complex relationships
- Audit logging
- Change tracking
- Data versioning
- Archive management
- Bulk operations
- Cache management

### Advanced Capabilities (Nice to Have)
- Event sourcing
- CQRS patterns
- Real-time sync
- Data analytics
- ML integration
- Predictive loading
- Auto-optimization
- Schema evolution
