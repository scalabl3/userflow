## Epic: Quick Site Launch
As a site implementer
I want a streamlined deployment process
So that I can launch new sites quickly

### STORY-DEPLOY-001: Quick Start
As a developer
I want minimal setup steps
So that I can start building immediately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I create a new site
   When I clone the template
   Then I should:
   - Run npm/yarn install
   - Copy .env.example
   - Start development server
   And begin customizing

2. Given I'm developing
   When I make changes
   Then I should:
   - See live updates
   - Get clear errors
   - Have working APIs
   And iterate quickly

### STORY-DEPLOY-002: Easy Launch
As a developer
I want simple deployment
So that I can go live confidently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given code is ready
   When I deploy to Vercel
   Then I should:
   - Connect repository
   - Set environment variables
   - Deploy automatically
   And launch quickly

2. Given site is live
   When I verify
   Then I should:
   - Test core features
   - Check admin access
   - Verify payments
   And confirm success

### Technical Notes

### Core Requirements
- Fast setup
  - Standard package manager
  - Example environment file
  - Development server
- Simple deployment
  - Git-based deployment
  - Environment variables
  - Basic health checks

### Implementation Constraints
- Must use npm/yarn

Note: Focus is on quick setup and deployment for sites under 10K users.
More complex deployment needs can be added as sites grow.
