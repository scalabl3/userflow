# Deployment Story

## Story 1: Local Development Environment Setup

As a developer
I want to have a streamlined local development environment
So that I can quickly test and iterate on the application

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given the repository is cloned
   When I run `npm run build`
   Then the application builds successfully

2. Given the application is built
   When I run `npm start`
   Then the application runs locally

3. Given the application is running
   When I make changes to the code
   Then the changes are reflected in the development environment

### Technical Notes

#### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- Proper npm scripts configuration in package.json
- Development environment variables setup
- Basic error handling and logging
- Hot reload functionality for development

System-wide Constraints:
- Must work on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Minimal external dependencies
- Clear console output for build and run processes

Implementation Requirements:
- Configure build process
- Set up development server
- Implement basic logging
- Document environment setup

# =====================================================
# SCOPE BOUNDARY - Base Implementation Ends Here
# =====================================================

#### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
- Development environment optimization
- Build process optimization
- Enhanced debugging capabilities

#### Advanced Capabilities (Nice to Have)
- Docker development environment
- Multi-environment configuration
- Advanced debugging tools

## Story 2: Online Deployment Configuration (Optional)

As a developer
I want to deploy the application to a cloud platform
So that I can test the application in a production-like environment

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Given the application is ready for deployment
   When I push to the main branch
   Then Vercel automatically deploys the application

2. Given a pull request is created
   When the PR is opened
   Then a preview deployment is automatically created

3. Given the deployment is complete
   When I visit the deployment URL
   Then I can access the application online

### Technical Notes

#### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- Vercel project configuration
- Monorepo settings for deployment
- Basic environment variables setup
- Deployment documentation

System-wide Constraints:
- Must maintain security best practices
- No sensitive data in version control
- Clear deployment logs and status

Implementation Requirements:
- Set up Vercel integration
- Configure deployment settings
- Document deployment process
- Implement basic monitoring

# =====================================================
# SCOPE BOUNDARY - Base Implementation Ends Here
# =====================================================

#### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
- Custom domain configuration
- Enhanced monitoring and logging
- Automated testing in deployment pipeline

#### Advanced Capabilities (Nice to Have)
- Advanced CI/CD pipeline
- Blue-green deployments
- Automated rollback procedures
