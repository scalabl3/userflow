# Deployment Stories

## Epic: Development and Deployment
As a developer
I want reliable development and deployment
So that I can build and ship confidently

### STORY-DEPLOY-001: Local Development
As a developer
I want a simple development setup
So that I can start working quickly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I clone the repo
   When I follow setup steps
   Then I should:
   - Run clear commands
   - See helpful output
   - Get working environment
   And start developing

2. Given I'm developing
   When I make changes
   Then I should:
   - See live updates
   - Get clear feedback
   - Spot any issues
   And work efficiently

3. Given something fails
   When I check the output
   Then I should:
   - See what went wrong
   - Know how to fix it
   - Find help docs
   And resolve issues

### STORY-DEPLOY-002: Production Deployment
As a developer
I want reliable deployment
So that I can ship with confidence

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given code is ready
   When I deploy to production
   Then I should:
   - Use simple commands
   - See deployment progress
   - Get clear feedback
   And ship confidently

2. Given deployment runs
   When it completes
   Then I should:
   - Know it succeeded
   - See it's working
   - Access the app
   And verify changes

3. Given deployment fails
   When I check status
   Then I should:
   - See clear errors
   - Know what failed
   - Have next steps
   And fix issues

### Technical Notes
