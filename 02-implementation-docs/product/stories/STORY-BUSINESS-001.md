# Business Layer Stories

## Epic: Core Business Logic Foundation
As a developer
I want a well-structured business logic layer
So that I can implement domain rules and processing consistently across the application

### STORY-BUSINESS-001: Core Service Layer
As a developer
I want standardized service implementations
So that I can maintain consistent business logic and domain rules

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am implementing business logic
   When I create new services
   Then I should have:
   - Standard service patterns
   - Clear dependency injection
   - Error handling structure
   - Transaction management
   And maintain business rule isolation

2. Given I am processing domain logic
   When I implement business rules
   Then I should have:
   - Validation frameworks
   - Business rule engines
   - Event handling
   - State management
   And maintain consistency

3. Given I am extending services
   When I add new functionality
   Then I should:
   - Follow established patterns
   - Maintain separation of concerns
   - Document dependencies
   - Handle errors appropriately
   And preserve system integrity
