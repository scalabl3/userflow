# Organization Management Stories

## Definitions
**Shadow Organization**: An organization record that maintains the same data structure and functionality as a regular organization but includes an indicator flag marking it as a shadow/hidden organization. Created automatically for individual accounts to maintain data consistency without requiring explicit organization details.

## Epic: Organization Setup and Management
As a system user
I want flexible organization support
So that I can either operate individually or as part of a larger organization based on my needs

### STORY-ORG-001: Organization Feature Toggle
As a system administrator
I want to control organization features visibility and functionality
So that I can enable/disable organization features based on subscription levels

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am configuring the system
   When I set up subscription levels
   Then I should be able to specify which levels include organization features

2. Given a user signs up for an individual account
   When they select a subscription level without organization features
   Then a Shadow Organization should be created automatically to maintain data structure

3. Given an organization exists
   When the subscription level changes
   Then only the feature visibility and functionality should change, not the underlying data structure

4. Given a user downgrades their subscription
   When the new level doesn't include organization features
   Then the organization's shadow flag should be set to true
   And organization data should be preserved but organization features should become hidden/inactive

### STORY-ORG-002: Individual vs Organization Account
As a new user
I want to choose between individual and organization accounts
So that I can select the appropriate account type for my needs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am on the signup page
   When my subscription level includes organization features
   Then I should see options for individual or organization account

2. Given I choose an individual account
   When I complete the signup
   Then a Shadow Organization should be created with a system-generated identifier
   And organization features should be hidden

3. Given I have an individual account with a Shadow Organization
   When I later need organization features
   Then I should be able to enable organization features through subscription upgrade
   And provide actual organization details
   And the shadow flag should be set to false

### STORY-ORG-003: Organization Creation
As a user with organization-enabled subscription
I want to create an organization
So that I can collaborate with other users under one entity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am eligible for organization features
   When I create an organization
   Then it should be set up with organization features enabled
   And the shadow flag should be set to false

2. Given I am creating an organization
   When I submit the form
   Then I should automatically become the organization owner with full admin rights

3. Given I have created an organization
   When the setup is complete
   Then I should receive welcome notifications through configured channels (email and/or SMS)

4. Given I am creating an organization
   When I enter a name that already exists
   Then I should receive a clear error message

### STORY-ORG-004: Organization Settings Management
As an organization administrator
I want to manage my organization's settings
So that I can customize it according to our needs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I have organization features enabled
   When I access organization settings
   Then I should see all organization configuration options

2. Given I have organization features disabled
   When I access settings
   Then I should only see individual user-relevant options
   And organization-specific settings should be hidden but preserved

3. Given I am in organization settings
   When I update organization details
   Then changes should be saved and reflected immediately

### STORY-ORG-005: Organization Member Management
As an organization administrator
I want to manage organization members
So that I can control who has access to our organization

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I have organization features enabled
   When I try to invite members
   Then I should be able to send invitations

2. Given I have organization features disabled
   When I access member management
   Then I should see an upgrade prompt for organization features
   And existing member data should be preserved but hidden

3. Given I am an organization admin
   When I remove members
   Then their access should be immediately revoked

4. Given I am viewing members
   When organization features are enabled
   Then I should see their roles and last activity

### STORY-ORG-006: Organization Data Isolation
As a user
I want my data to be properly isolated
So that I can ensure my information is secure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am using the system
   When I access any data
   Then I should only see my organization's information

2. Given I have organization features enabled
   When I access organization data
   Then I should see appropriate aggregated data

3. Given my subscription changes
   When organization features are toggled
   Then all organization data should remain intact regardless of feature visibility

## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- Implement Shadow Organizations with identical data structure as regular organizations
- Support feature visibility control through subscription levels
- Maintain organization data integrity regardless of feature state
- Implement organization ID-based data isolation
- Support audit logging for organization changes
- Handle organization deletion properly
- Support organization feature toggling
- Implement basic member management

System-wide Constraints:
- Shadow Organizations use identical data structure as regular organizations
- Organization IDs must be used in all relevant database queries
- Subscription changes only affect feature visibility/functionality, not data structure
- Organization data isolation must be maintained at all times
- Feature visibility is determined by subscription level flags

Implementation Requirements:
- Basic organization CRUD operations
- Simple member management
- Core audit logging
- Essential data isolation
- Basic subscription level checks
- Standard organization fields

# =====================================================
# SCOPE BOUNDARY - Base Implementation Ends Here
# =====================================================
# The following section describes features that are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE
# for the base template implementation. These are documented for awareness and future
# extension possibilities only.

### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
- Support advanced member management
- Enable organization analytics
- Implement custom organization fields
- Support organization hierarchies
- Enable bulk member operations
- Support organization templates

### Advanced Capabilities (Nice to Have)
- Support multi-region organizations
- Enable advanced analytics
- Implement organization networks
- Support custom member roles
- Enable organization federation
- Support advanced audit capabilities

# Future Enterprise Organization Considerations
- Enterprise organization features (not implemented in base template):
  - Advanced organizational hierarchies
  - Cross-organization collaboration
  - Enterprise-wide analytics
  - Custom organizational structures
  - Advanced member lifecycle management
  - Organization compliance tracking
Note: These enterprise features require additional infrastructure and should be considered as extension points rather than base template features.
