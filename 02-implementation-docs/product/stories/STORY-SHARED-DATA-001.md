# Shared Data Stories

## Epic: Shared Data Foundation
As a developer
I want a unified type system and persistence layer
So that I can build features with consistent data handling

### STORY-SHARED-DATA-001: Core Domain Types
As a developer
I want shared domain types with persistence
So that I can work with data consistently across the monorepo

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I need domain types
   When building features
   Then I should have:
   - Core type definitions
   - Prisma schema mapping
   - Type-safe operations
   And maintain consistency

2. Given I use these types
   When implementing features
   Then I should:
   - Get full type safety
   - Have persistence
   - See relationships
   And work efficiently

3. Given I extend types
   When adding features
   Then I should:
   - Update type definitions
   - Extend Prisma schema
   - Maintain mappings
   And stay consistent

### STORY-SHARED-DATA-002: Data Operations
As a developer
I want type-safe data operations
So that I can manage data reliably

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I need data access
   When building features
   Then I should have:
   - Type-safe queries
   - CRUD operations
   - Error handling
   And maintain integrity

2. Given I fetch data
   When implementing features
   Then I should:
   - Get typed results
   - Handle filtering
   - Support pagination
   And work efficiently

3. Given I modify data
   When saving changes
   Then I should:
   - Validate types
   - Handle errors
   - Maintain consistency
   And prevent issues

### STORY-SHARED-DATA-003: Data Model Extension
As an application developer
I want to extend the base data models
So that I can add application-specific data while maintaining type safety

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I need custom fields
   When extending base models
   Then I should have:
   - Clear extension patterns
   - Type generation
   - Migration tools
   And maintain data integrity

2. Given I add relationships
   When connecting models
   Then I should:
   - Preserve existing relations
   - Add new connections
   - Update type definitions
   And keep referential integrity

3. Given I need custom operations
   When implementing features
   Then I should:
   - Extend base queries
   - Add new operations
   - Maintain type safety
   And follow framework patterns

## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements
- Domain types
- Schema mapping
- Type safety
- Data access
- Error handling
- Testing support

### Extension Points
- Model extension patterns
- Field addition hooks
- Relation builders
- Query extensions
- Migration utilities
- Type generators

### System-wide Constraints
- Single source of truth
- Type safety everywhere
- Data integrity
- Clear patterns
- Test coverage
- Simple extensions
- Safe migrations

### Implementation Guidelines
- Keep models focused
- Use clear naming
- Document extensions
- Maintain migrations
- Test thoroughly
- Provide examples
- Enable safe evolution
