# Role and Permission Management Stories

## Epic: Role-Based Access Control
As a system administrator
I want to manage roles and permissions across the system
So that I can control access to features and data securely

### STORY-ROLE-001: Core Role Management
As a system administrator
I want to create and manage roles
So that I can define access patterns for users and organizations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am setting up the system
   When I create a new role
   Then I should be able to:
   - Define a unique role identifier
   - Set a display name and description
   - Specify role hierarchy (if any)
   - Set role scope (system-wide, organization-specific)
   - Define role inheritance rules

2. Given I am managing roles
   When I modify a role
   Then I should:
   - Maintain existing user assignments
   - Update permission mappings
   - Log all changes for audit
   - Notify affected administrators
   And changes should propagate to all affected users

3. Given roles exist in the system
   When viewing role management
   Then I should see:
   - Total users per role
   - Permission sets assigned
   - Creation and modification dates
   - Role relationships and hierarchy
   And be able to export role audit reports

### STORY-ROLE-002: Permission Management
As a system administrator
I want to manage granular permissions
So that I can define precise access controls for roles

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am defining permissions
   When I create a new permission
   Then I should be able to:
   - Set a unique permission identifier
   - Define the resource type it applies to
   - Specify allowed operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Set permission scope (system, organization, user)
   - Define any constraints or conditions

2. Given I am managing permissions
   When I assign permissions to roles
   Then I should:
   - See conflicts with existing permissions
   - Understand inheritance implications
   - Preview affected users
   - Set effective dates for changes
   And maintain consistent permission state

3. Given permissions are assigned
   When they take effect
   Then the system should:
   - Apply new access rules immediately
   - Maintain existing sessions appropriately
   - Log all permission changes
   - Notify affected administrators
   And handle edge cases gracefully

### STORY-ROLE-003: Role Assignment
As an administrator
I want to assign roles to users and organizations
So that I can manage access control effectively

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am managing a user or organization
   When I assign roles
   Then I should be able to:
   - Select from available roles for the scope
   - Set role assignment duration (permanent/temporary)
   - Define any role-specific parameters
   - See effective permissions
   And validate role compatibility

2. Given I am assigning organization roles
   When the organization is a shadow organization
   Then I should:
   - Only see applicable shadow organization roles
   - Maintain consistent base access
   - Prevent privilege escalation
   And maintain role separation

3. Given roles are assigned
   When viewing user or organization details
   Then I should see:
   - All active role assignments
   - Role assignment history
   - Effective permissions
   - Role conflicts or issues
   And be able to modify assignments

4. Given temporary roles exist
   When they expire
   Then the system should:
   - Remove role access automatically
   - Maintain role history
   - Notify relevant administrators
   - Log all changes
   And handle session updates appropriately

## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- Implement role hierarchy with inheritance
- Support both system and organization-specific roles
- Maintain role assignment history
- Implement role conflict detection
- Support role-based access control (RBAC)
- Maintain audit logs for all role changes
- Implement fine-grained permission control
- Support permission inheritance rules
- Implement permission conflict resolution
- Implement role assignment validation
- Handle role assignment conflicts
- Handle cross-organization role management
- Support extensible permission schema
- Design for multi-organization role management
- Implement basic role delegation

System-wide Constraints:
- Role uniqueness is system-wide within scope (system/organization)
- Permission inheritance follows strict hierarchy
- Role assignments must respect organization boundaries
- Permission changes propagate immediately to all sessions
- Role conflicts are prevented at assignment time
- Audit logging is mandatory for all role/permission changes

Implementation Requirements:
- Basic role hierarchy (no circular dependencies)
- Standard permission types (CRUD)
- Basic role assignment workflows
- Simple permission inheritance
- Core audit logging
- Essential conflict detection

# =====================================================
# SCOPE BOUNDARY - Base Implementation Ends Here
# =====================================================
# The following section describes features that are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE
# for the base template implementation. These are documented for awareness and future
# extension possibilities only.

### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
- Support temporary role assignments
- Enable role assignment scheduling
- Support permission grouping and sets
- Enable bulk role operations
- Support role assignment delegation
- Implement advanced audit trails
- Support custom permission types

### Advanced Capabilities (Nice to Have)
- Enable attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Support dynamic permission evaluation
- Implement risk-based role assignment
- Enable context-aware permissions
- Support advanced delegation patterns
- Implement behavioral analysis for permissions

# Future Enterprise Role Considerations
- Enterprise role features (not implemented in base template):
  - Advanced workflow automation
  - AI-powered role suggestions
  - Predictive access patterns
  - Advanced compliance tracking
  - Custom role inheritance patterns
  - Dynamic role composition
Note: These enterprise features require additional infrastructure and should be considered as extension points rather than base template features.
