## Epic: System Administration Interface
As a system administrator
I want to manage and monitor the entire system
So that I can ensure proper operation and support all users/organizations

Note: System administration is distinct from organization administration (RBAC roles).
System administrators manage the entire platform, while organization admins manage
their specific organization.

### STORY-ADMIN-UI-001: System Dashboard
As a system administrator
I want a clear system-wide dashboard
So that I can monitor overall platform health and usage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I access the system dashboard
   When I view system metrics
   Then I should see:
   - Total user count
   - Total organization count
   - Recent registrations
   - System health status
   And data should refresh automatically

2. Given I analyze platform usage
   When I view trends
   Then I should see:
   - System-wide activity metrics
   - Resource usage patterns
   - Performance indicators
   And identify potential issues

### STORY-ADMIN-UI-002: User & Organization Management
As a system administrator
I want to manage all users and organizations
So that I can provide system-wide support

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I manage the system
   When I view users/organizations
   Then I should see:
   - All user accounts
   - All organizations
   - Account/feature status
   And manage effectively

2. Given I support a user/organization
   When I access their details
   Then I should:
   - View complete information
   - See their organization roles
   - Manage account status
   - Reset critical items
   And maintain privacy/security

### STORY-ADMIN-UI-003: System Audit Log
As a system administrator
I want a comprehensive audit log
So that I can track system-wide activities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I review system logs
   When I view activities
   Then I should see:
   - All system-wide actions
   - User/org context
   - Action details
   - Affected resources
   And understand platform usage

2. Given I investigate issues
   When I search audit logs
   Then I should:
   - Filter by multiple criteria
   - Export filtered results
   - See related events
   And resolve problems quickly

### Technical Notes
