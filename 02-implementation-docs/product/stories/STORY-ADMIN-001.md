# Administration Management Stories

## Epic: System Administration and Monitoring
As a system administrator
I want comprehensive tools and insights
So that I can effectively manage and monitor the system

### STORY-ADMIN-001: System Health Dashboard
As a system administrator
I want a centralized health dashboard
So that I can monitor system status and performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am on the admin dashboard
   When I view system health
   Then I should see:
   - Service status indicators
   - Key performance metrics
   - Resource utilization
   - Active alert counts
   And metrics should update in real-time

2. Given I am viewing metrics
   When I select a time range
   Then I should see historical data
   And be able to identify trends
   And export data for analysis

3. Given there is a system issue
   When metrics exceed thresholds
   Then I should see clear visual indicators
   And receive appropriate notifications

### STORY-ADMIN-002: Cross-Organization Management
As a system administrator
I want to manage multiple organizations
So that I can maintain system-wide consistency and support

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am in admin mode
   When I view organizations
   Then I should see:
   - Organization status
   - User counts
   - Resource usage
   - Compliance status
   And be able to sort/filter the list

2. Given I select an organization
   When I access management tools
   Then I should be able to:
   - View detailed settings
   - Modify configurations
   - Access audit logs
   - Manage feature flags
   Without affecting other organizations

3. Given I need to implement system-wide changes
   When I use bulk operations
   Then I should be able to:
   - Preview affected organizations
   - Schedule changes
   - Monitor progress
   And roll back if needed

### STORY-ADMIN-003: Audit Trail Management
As a system administrator
I want comprehensive audit capabilities
So that I can track and investigate system activities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I access audit logs
   When I view system activities
   Then I should see:
   - Timestamp
   - Actor details
   - Action performed
   - Affected resources
   And be able to filter by any field

2. Given I am investigating an incident
   When I search audit logs
   Then I should be able to:
   - Use advanced search criteria
   - Follow action chains
   - Export findings
   And maintain data integrity

3. Given audit logs exist
   When retention periods expire
   Then logs should be:
   - Archived securely
   - Accessible if needed
   - Properly anonymized
   And comply with regulations

## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- Implement real-time system monitoring
- Support cross-organization management
- Maintain comprehensive audit logs
- Implement health check systems
- Support basic metric collection:
  - Daily new user registration count
  - Daily Active Users (DAU)
  - Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Enable essential admin operations
- Implement alert management

System-wide Constraints:
- Admin operations must be logged
- Cross-org operations require explicit confirmation
- Metric collection must be performant
- Audit logs must be immutable
- Admin actions respect org boundaries
- Alert thresholds are system-wide

Implementation Requirements:
- Basic health monitoring
- Standard audit logging
- Essential admin operations
- Core metric collection:
  - Registration tracking
  - Active user counting (daily/monthly)
  - Basic trend visualization
- Simple alert system
- Basic reporting tools

# =====================================================
# SCOPE BOUNDARY - Base Implementation Ends Here
# =====================================================
# The following section describes features that are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE
# for the base template implementation. These are documented for awareness and future
# extension possibilities only.

### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
- Advanced metric visualization
- Custom alert rules
- Enhanced audit analysis
- Predictive monitoring
- Advanced reporting tools
- Bulk operation tools

### Advanced Capabilities (Nice to Have)
- AI-powered system analysis
- Predictive maintenance
- Advanced anomaly detection
- Custom monitoring frameworks
- Advanced forensics tools
- Automated response systems

# Future Enterprise Administration Considerations
- Enterprise admin features (not implemented in base template):
  - Advanced compliance monitoring
  - Custom audit frameworks
  - ML-based system optimization
  - Advanced forensics capabilities
  - Custom admin workflows
  - Automated governance systems

# Metric Collection Possibilities
## Database-Derived Metrics (Simple)
- Daily new user registration count
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Registration completion rates
- Organization creation frequency
- Role modification frequency

## External Service Metrics (Complex)
- Application Performance (APM tools)
  - Request latency tracking
  - Error rate monitoring
  - Endpoint usage patterns
  - Query performance stats

## Authentication Metrics (Auth providers)
- Login success/failure rates
- 2FA usage statistics
- Password reset frequencies
- Session duration patterns

Note: These metrics represent possibilities for future enhancement, with database-derived metrics being simplest to implement first.
