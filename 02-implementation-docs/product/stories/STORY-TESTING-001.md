# Testing Standards Stories

## Epic: Quality Assurance Foundation
As a development team
I want comprehensive testing standards and patterns
So that I can ensure reliability and maintainability across the application

### STORY-TESTING-001: Core Testing Framework
As a developer
I want standardized testing patterns and tools
So that I can consistently verify functionality across all layers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I am writing tests
   When I implement test suites
   Then I should have:
   - Unit testing framework
   - Integration testing tools
   - E2E testing capabilities
   - Test utilities/helpers
   And maintain consistent patterns

2. Given I am testing different layers
   When I write layer-specific tests
   Then I should have:
   - Frontend component testing
   - API endpoint testing
   - Business logic testing
   - Data layer testing
   And ensure proper isolation

3. Given I am running tests
   When in different environments
   Then I should have:
   - Local test execution
   - CI pipeline integration
   - Environment configuration
   - Report generation
   And maintain reproducibility

## Technical Notes

### Core Requirements (Must Have)
- Unit testing framework
- Integration testing tools
- E2E testing setup
- Mock/Stub utilities
- Assertion libraries
- Coverage reporting
- Test runners
- CI integration

System-wide Constraints:
- Minimum coverage requirements
- Isolated test environments
- Deterministic results
- Performance thresholds
- Memory constraints
- Timeout limits
- Parallel execution
- Resource cleanup

Implementation Requirements:
- Test organization
- Naming conventions
- Setup/Teardown patterns
- Mock data management

- Report formatting
- Error handling
- Debug support

### Extension Patterns
- Custom test decorators
- Helper functions
- Fixture management
- Data generators
- Assert extensions
- Report customization
- Hook system
- Utility expansion

### Implementation Guidelines for AI Collaboration
- Test organization
- Pattern documentation
- Extension examples
- Error handling
- Setup patterns
- Cleanup procedures
- Naming conventions
- Coverage standards
