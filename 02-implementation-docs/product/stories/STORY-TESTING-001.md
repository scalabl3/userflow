# Testing Stories

## Epic: Testing Foundation
As a developer
I want reliable testing tools
So that I can ensure quality

### STORY-TESTING-001: Core Testing
As a developer
I want essential testing setup
So that I can verify functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I write tests
   When implementing features
   Then I should have:
   - Unit test tools
   - Integration tests
   - E2E basics
   And write good tests

2. Given I run tests
   When checking code
   Then I should:
   - Get clear results
   - See test coverage
   - Find issues fast
   And fix problems

3. Given tests fail
   When debugging
   Then I should:
   - See what failed
   - Know why it failed
   - Find related code
   And fix quickly

### STORY-TESTING-002: Test Patterns
As a developer
I want consistent patterns
So that I can test effectively

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given I need patterns
   When writing tests
   Then I should have:
   - Clear examples
   - Common setups
   - Useful helpers
   And stay consistent

2. Given I use patterns
   When testing features
   Then I should:
   - Follow standards
   - Use best practices
   - Write clean tests
   And work efficiently

3. Given I add tests
   When covering new code
   Then I should:
   - Match patterns
   - Maintain quality
   - Update coverage
   And stay reliable
