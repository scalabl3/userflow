## Initiative Information
```markdown
ID: SI-BASE-001
Title: Base Application Framework Implementation
Created: 2024-01-07
Status: PLANNING

Pattern Category: FOUNDATION
Related Patterns:
- Multi-tenant Organization -> User/Org Management
- Role-based Access Control -> Security/Permissions
- Session Management -> User Experience/Security
- Shared Type System -> Cross-Package Consistency
```

## Strategic Analysis

### 1. Pattern Recognition
```markdown
Core Patterns from Vision & Stories:
1. Organization Management
   - Multi-tenant architecture
   - Shadow organizations
   - Flexible organization features
   - Data isolation

2. User & Authentication
   - Multiple auth workflows
   - Session management
   - Device tracking
   - Progressive profiles

3. Role & Permission
   - Role hierarchy
   - Permission inheritance
   - Scope-based access
   - Audit capabilities

4. Technical Architecture
   - Shared type system
   - Business logic isolation
   - API standardization
   - Frontend separation
```

### 2. Success Metrics
```markdown
1. Development Efficiency
   Base Metrics (from Vision):
   - 80% reduction in setup time
   - Zero compromise of security
   - Minimal customization needed

   Implementation Metrics:
   - Type safety across packages
   - Test coverage > 90%
   - Documentation completeness
   - Pattern compliance

2. System Performance
   Base Metrics (from Vision):

   - 99.9% uptime
   - 1000+ organization scale

   Implementation Metrics:
   - Query optimization
   - Resource utilization
   - Error rate < 0.1%
   - Cache effectiveness

3. User Experience
   Base Metrics (from Vision):
   - < 3s initial page load
   - < 300ms interactions
   - Zero-downtime updates

   Implementation Metrics:
   - Auth flow completion rate
   - Session stability
   - Error recovery speed
   - Feature accessibility
```

   Location: 02-implementation-docs/tactical/TI-BASE001-002/
   Focus:
   - Multi-tenant structure
   - Shadow organizations
   - Data isolation
   - Organization features

3. TI-BASE001-003: User Authentication
   Purpose: Implement user management and auth
   Location: 02-implementation-docs/tactical/TI-BASE001-003/
   Focus:
   - Auth workflows
   - Session management
   - Profile management
   - Device tracking

4. TI-BASE001-004: Role Management
   Purpose: Implement RBAC system
   Location: 02-implementation-docs/tactical/TI-BASE001-004/
   Focus:
   - Role hierarchy
   - Permission system
   - Access control
   - Audit logging
```

   - Test infrastructure

2. Organization Core (TI-BASE001-002)
   - Data structures
   - Feature toggles
   - Isolation mechanisms
   - Organization workflows

3. User Authentication (TI-BASE001-003)
   - Auth implementations
   - Session handling
   - Profile management
   - Security features

4. Role Management (TI-BASE001-004)
   - Role structures
   - Permission handling
   - Access enforcement
   - Audit systems
```
