# BuildFlow

## RELATIONSHIPS
Purpose: Define all inheritance and compositional relationships this class participates in.
Success Criteria: All relationships are explicitly defined with clear direction and cardinality.
Failure Criteria: Any relationship is ambiguous or missing implementation context.

### Is-A Relationships
```markdown
ðŸ”’ ##### Model Reference:

- BuildFlow is-a BaseFlow (with build-specific orchestration)
  - WatchFlow is-a BuildFlow (scope: development mode)

ðŸ”’ End Model
```

### Has-A Relationships
```markdown
ðŸ”’ ##### Model Reference:

- BuildFlow has-many BuildStage           // Multiple stage containment
- BuildFlow has-one BuildValidator        // Validation service
- BuildFlow has-one AnalysisReporter      // Build analysis
- BuildFlow has-one IncrementalCache      // Build caching

BuildFlow
â”œâ”€â”€ stages: Map<string, BuildStage>    // Stage management
â”œâ”€â”€ validator: BuildValidator          // Stage validation
â”œâ”€â”€ reporter: AnalysisReporter        // Build reporting
â””â”€â”€ cache: IncrementalCache          // Build optimization

ðŸ”’ End Model
```

### Action Relationships
```markdown
ðŸ”’ ##### Model Reference:

BuildFlow executes BuildStage        // Orchestrates stage execution
- BuildFlow validates-with BuildValidator  // Ensures stage validity
- BuildFlow reports-through AnalysisReporter // Tracks metrics

BuildFlow
â”œâ”€â”€ execute(): Promise<void>         // Stage execution
â”œâ”€â”€ validate(): Promise<boolean>     // Stage validation
â””â”€â”€ report(): Promise<void>          // Build reporting

ðŸ”’ End Model
```

### Ownership Relationships
```markdown
ðŸ”’ ##### Model Reference:

BuildFlow owns BuildStage         // Full lifecycle control
- BuildFlow manages BuildValidator   // Validation lifecycle

BuildFlow
â”œâ”€â”€ stages: owned BuildStage[]    // Full ownership
â””â”€â”€ validator: managed BuildValidator // Lifecycle management

ðŸ”’ End Model
```

### Scoping Relationships
```markdown
ðŸ”’ ##### Model Reference:

BuildFlow scoped-to BuildContext          // Build environment scope
- BuildFlow within BuildConfiguration     // Configuration boundaries

BuildFlow
â”œâ”€â”€ context: BuildContext           // Build scope
â””â”€â”€ config: BuildConfiguration     // Build boundaries

ðŸ”’ End Model
```

## 1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Purpose
```markdown
ðŸ”’ ##### Model Reference:

BuildFlow serves as the central orchestrator for the build process, managing the execution, validation, and analysis of build stages in a single-direction flow pattern. It ensures stages execute in the correct order, validates their outputs, and maintains build optimization through caching.

ðŸ”’ End Model
```

```markdown
ðŸ”’ ##### Model Reference:

1. RELIABILITY: Ensures consistent and reliable builds through strict stage management
2. EFFICIENCY: Optimizes build performance through intelligent caching and incremental builds
3. QUALITY: Enforces build quality through comprehensive validation
4. EXTENSIBILITY: Provides clear extension points for custom build stages

ðŸ”’ End Model
```

### 1.3 Primary Use Cases
```markdown
ðŸ”’ ##### Model Reference:

1. CLEAN_BUILD: Execute a complete build from clean state
2. INCREMENTAL_BUILD: Execute an optimized incremental build
3. VALIDATE_BUILD: Validate build stage outputs
4. ANALYZE_BUILD: Generate build metrics and reports
