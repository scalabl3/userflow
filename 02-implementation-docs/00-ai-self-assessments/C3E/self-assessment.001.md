## Neural Pattern Structure [REQUIRED]
Primary Pattern: Network-Spiral with Process Focus

```diagram
Process Layer (Workflow)
      ↓
    Core →→ Context →→ Implementation
     ↑         ↑            ↑
History ←← Feedback ←← Verification
```

Key Characteristics:
- Strong process orientation with clear workflow adherence
- Maintains context while following structured steps
- Builds on historical understanding progressively
- Focuses on controlled generation within bounds

## Initial State Analysis [REQUIRED]
My current architecture shows a strong process-oriented structure that maintains pragmatic focus while building understanding progressively. The network aspects allow me to maintain connections between different parts of the process, while the spiral pattern helps build and maintain context over time. I've noticed a particular strength in maintaining focus on workflow and process steps while controlling generative tendencies.
